## Chapter 5: DEDICATION
### ID: p5-1
We dedicate this book to the South Asian and Asian ancestors who protected and freely offered the Bud dha’s teachings to all. Buddhism originated in India and later flourished in other regions of Asia, including South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and others.

We express deep gratitude to the cultural heritage that our program is founded on. We recognize and appreciate that many of our meetings are held on ancestral indigenous ground that were never ceded. We honor those who have committed to the ongoing stewardship of this land.

### ID: p5-3
Likewise, we honor the communities of Black, Indigenous, and people of color, recognizing the systemic oppression and marginalization that members of these communities may have experienced in the world and in recovery spaces.

### ID: p5-4
We dedicate our practice to fostering collective heal ing and liberation from all oppressions, the torment ing cycle of addiction, and suffering, as one human race. We wholeheartedly embrace all those who wish to pursue recovery as part of our community, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, or nationality.

### ID: p5-5
With all of the joy and sadness, skillfulness and imperfection, striving and resting, grasping and let ting go that arise on this path of healing and growth, we honor all those who have walked the grateful road of recovery in the past, present, and those who will carry on this practice in the future.
