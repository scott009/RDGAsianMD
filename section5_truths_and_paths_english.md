# Section 5: Truths and Paths

## Chapter 12: AWAKENING: BUDDHA


### ID: p12-2
Most of us enter recovery with one goal in mind: to stop the suffering that got us here in the first place, whether that was drinking, using drugs, stealing, eating, gambling, sex, codependency, technology, or other process addictions. As newcomers, most of us would be satisfied with simple damage control or reduction in harmful behavior. We want to stop hurting ourselves or others in particular ways.

### ID: p12-3
You’re reading this because there is a spark of wisdom in you that desires to seek the end of the suffering of your addiction. You’ve already taken the first step on the path to your own awakening. Everyone who has made the wise intention to recover, wherever they are on their path, has accessed that pure, wise part of themselves that the wreckage of addiction can never touch.

### ID: p12-5
So many of us have hearts that are still in pain from the suffering we’ve experienced. Some have undergone trauma which often led us to seek temporary relief in our addictive behavior which unintentionally added more suffering to our original wounds. We tried to protect our selves by running from the pain, putting on a mask, and pushing people away for fear of being vulnerable, all to adapt to what often feels like a hostile world.

### ID: p12-7
We start to recover when we let ourselves believe in and rediscover our pure, radiant, and courageous heart where we find our potential for awakening resides. Who were we before the world got to us? Who are we beyond the obsession of our conditioned minds? Who are we beneath all our walls and heartbreak? Despite the trauma, addiction, fear, and shame, there is a still and centered part of us that remains whole. There is a part of us that’s not traumatized, that’s not addicted, that’s not ruled by fear or shame. This is where wisdom comes from, and it’s the foundation of our recovery.

### ID: p12-8
If you’re at the beginning of your recovery journey, it may seem impossible to access this part of you. But you’re here because you already have. Perhaps you felt some small glimmer of hope — maybe born out of desperation — that there might be a way out, that things could change if you took wise action and reached out for help. Maybe it feels impossible to have faith in this part of you, to believe that you have the potential to be capable of wisdom and kindness and ethical deeds, to believe you can be the source of your own healing and awakening. Recovery is a gradual process. This path is a lifetime of individual steps. It’s not only the Bud dha’s example that shows us the way, but also those before us who have gone through the process of recovery and made it to the other side.
They show us that we can, too.


### ID: p12-11
So what does the Buddha have to do with recovery?

### ID: p12-12
There are two ways in which we use the word Buddha, which means “awakened.” First, it is the title given to Siddhartha Gautama, a prince who lived in modern-day Nepal and India roughly 2,500 years ago. After many years of scholarly study, meditation, and ethical practice, he was awakened to the nature of human suffering and discovered a path that leads to the end of suffering, and the freedom that comes from awakening. After his awakening, Siddhartha came to be known as the Buddha. The second use of the word Buddha follows from the first. Bud dha can refer, not only to the historical figure but also to the idea of awakening: the fact that each of us has within ourselves the potential to awaken to the same understanding as the original Buddha. When we take refuge in the Buddha, we take refuge not in Siddhartha as a person, but in the fact that he was able to find freedom from his suffering and so can we.

## Chapter 13: THE STORY OF THE ORIGINAL BUDDHA

### ID: p13-1
To understand the nature of this awakening it could help to know something about the life of Siddhartha Gautama. One of the many versions of the story of the Buddha tells us that Siddhartha was a wealthy prince, born into privilege, and sheltered from much of the suffering of the world. The story goes that young Siddhartha sneaked away from his palace and saw people suffering from old age, sick ness, and death. He realized that no amount of privilege could protect him from this suffering. Wealth wouldn’t prevent it. Comfort wouldn’t prevent it. Pleasure wouldn’t prevent it. Despite having a life of ease, Sid dhartha still found that he experienced suffering and dissatisfaction. He was born with everything, but it wasn’t enough.

### ID: p13-2
This persistent dissatisfaction with life, whether dramatic or subtle, is called dukkha, a Pali word we still use today. All humans ex perience dukkha, but some of us — particularly those of us who have struggled with addiction — seem to experience it on a more intense level, and with worse consequences.

### ID: p13-3
What is addiction but the consistent and nagging feeling of “not enough?” What is addiction other than being constantly unsatisfied? 

### ID: p13-4
Siddhartha saw that pain was an unavoidable part of life, and he became determined to find a way to put an end to it. He left his family and for a time, lived the life of an ascetic — the extreme opposite to his previous life of comfort and wealth. As an ascetic, he sat in extremely un comfortable postures meditating for long periods of time. He slept very
little. He ate very little. He even tried breathing very little. He thought that, since material comfort hadn’t eliminated suffering, maybe the oppo site of material comfort would. At the brink of death, Siddhartha aban doned the idea of extreme asceticism and instead chose what he called “the middle path.”

### ID: p13-6
Siddhartha realized that both the extremes of pleasure and denial of pleasure had brought him nowhere nearer to liberation. Neither extreme had given relief from his suffering. So he set off on his own to meditate. Sitting beneath a Bodhi tree, he meditated deeply and discovered the path that leads to the end of suffering. He looked within himself for his own liberation, and he found it.

### ID: p13-7
What Siddhartha understood as he meditated under the Bodhi tree is known as the **Dharma**, or the “Truth,” which explains the causes and nature of cyclical suffering. It’s the basis of the teachings of Bud dhism. Central to this path are the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, which will be explained in the next chapter.

### ID: p13-8
Siddhartha was called the Buddha, or “The One Who Woke Up,” because most people go through life with a false sense of reality, like being in a trance. The Buddha spent the rest of his life developing the Dharma into a simple but sophisticated system. He shared it with anyone who would listen, dedicating himself to a life of service to free everybody from suffering. He defied the norms of his time by letting women and the poorest class of citizens become monastics. Everyone was welcome in his sangha, his spiritual community. Central to his teachings was the idea that liberation is available to all — to the most broken and oppressed among us, to the sick, to the powerless, to those who have lost everything, to those who have nothing left to lose. All of us, even the most addicted, the most lost, can find our way to awakening, because we all have the ability to access the pure, wise, and true nature within each of us.

## Chapter 14: WALKING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE BUDDHA

### ID: p14-1
The story of the Buddha may seem far removed from our every day reality, but his life before and after his awakening offers us a model for our own lives. All of us can relate to the inevitability of suffering. Aging, sickness, and death have touched us all. We’ve experienced the truth of impermanence — the highs we achieved in our addictions al ways wore off, but we kept chasing them anyway. We’ve also endured other forms of suffering, some self-inflicted and some at the hands of others. And we’ve dealt with subtle forms of dukkha: the annoyances, the boredom, the loss of what we want, the inability to keep what we have, the impatience with life, the refusal to accept what is. And what have we done with these experiences of suffering?

### ID: p14-4
At this point most of our stories start to look different from Siddhartha’s, and this difference is what led us here. Instead of sitting with our suffering, we found ways to change it, avoid it, or replace it with something more pleasurable. For some of us, that came in the form of drinking or using drugs. Others used sex, relationships, food, 
self-harming, technology, work, or gambling. And some of our stories contain a version of “all of the above.” Whatever the behavior, it was just a tempo rary solution that always led to deeper suffering for ourselves and others.

### ID: p14-6
We’ve come to realize that our stories don’t have to continue like this. The life of Siddhartha, and the lives of the countless people we meet in recovery who have found an end to the suffering of addiction, prove to us that there is another way.

### ID: p14-7
We can look back on our own lives and see clearly the path that brought us here. We can examine our own actions and intentions and come to understand how we shape our own future. And we can gain insight into the nature of our own suffering and follow a path that leads to less harm and less suffering.

### ID: p14-8
The Buddha began as a layperson with suffering, just like us. This is not a path of miracle or blind-faith. This is a path of practice and the Buddha can be an ideal that inspires us. Experience has shown us that good results come when we put the necessary effort into our own recovery. This is a program of empowerment: we take responsibility for our own intentions and actions. The Sangha is here to help us along the way. We don’t have to identify as Buddhists, and we don’t have to meditate for hours each day. But we have found that the path outlined in the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path can lead us to liberation from both the suffering of addiction and the suffering that comes from simply being human. We trust in the potential in all of us to find freedom from this suffering.


## Chapter 15: THE TRUTH: DHARMA


### ID: p15-2
As people who have struggled with addiction, we’re already inti mately familiar with the truth of suffering. Even if we’ve never heard of the Buddha, at some level we already understand the core of the teach ings: that in this life, there is suffering.

### ID: p15-3
It can be incredibly liberating to hear this said so plainly and directly. No one is trying to convince or convert us. No one is telling us we have to believe something. No one is sugarcoating our experience.

### ID: p15-4
The Buddha also taught the way to free ourselves from this suf fering. When the Buddha awakened, he understood how samsāra, or the cycle of existence, came to be and how it is maintained. The heart of these teachings (which we call the Dharma) is the Four Noble Truths. These four truths, and the corresponding commitments, are the foundation of our program:

### ID: p15-5
1. There is suffering. We committ to understanding the truth of suffering
2.  There is a cause of suffering. We committ to understanding that craving craving leads to suffering
3.  There is a way to end suffering. We commit to understanding the less craving leads to less suffering. T
4.  here is a path that leads to the end of suffering. We committ to cultivating the path.

### ID: p15-6
Like a map that shows us the path, these truths help us find our way in recovery.

## Chapter 16: THE FIRST NOBLE TRUTH:

### ID: p16-1
#### Class: subtitle
There is Suffering

### ID: p16-2
Some of the ways in which we may experience suffering are obvi ous, like poverty, hunger, pain, disappointment, and feeling separated or excluded. There is also suffering due to the divisions of our world, such as war, colonization, and oppression. Some are less obvious, like feelings of cravings, anxiety, stress, and uncertainty. We also suffer as we struggle with birth, aging, sickness, and death. As much as we want to avoid what we consider unpleasant and hold onto what we label as pleasant, dissatis faction, separation, loss, and injustice still may frequently arise. Suffering occurs whenever we fail to see the true nature of our existence, when we insist on controlling or altering our reality.

### ID: p16-3
The First Noble Truth rests on the understanding that our lives seem unsatisfactory because experiences are impermanent and impersonal. Our senses (which the Buddha understood to include not just hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touch, but also thinking) are often unreli able and temporary, which means that the way we experience and make sense of the world is constantly changing and subjective. We suffer be cause we keep expecting these temporary experiences to be permanent and absolute, and to satisfy our craving for pleasure or to avoid pain. 

### ID: p16-4
Many of us have suffered by trying and failing to control our dependencies, habits, and addictions. We’ve used every kind of willpow er, bargaining, planning, and magical thinking; each time imagining the result would be different, and blaming ourselves when it turned out the same.

### ID: p16-7
How many times did we promise: “Just this one last time, then I’m done? I’ll just use or drink on the weekends, or only after work, or only on special occasions. I’ll never drink in the morning. I won’t do the hard stuff. I’ll never get high alone. I’ll never use at work or around my family. I’ll never drink and drive. I’ll never use needles.”

### ID: p16-8
How many diets have we tried? How many times have we said we wouldn’t binge, or purge, or restrict calories, or over-exercise? How many times have we looked at the scars on our arms and vowed to never cut again? How many times have we let our wounds heal, only to break them open once more?

### ID: p16-9
How many limits have we set on ourselves around technology or work, only to get pulled back in? How many times have we vowed to have no more one-night stands, vowed to stay away from certain people or places or websites? How many times have we crossed our own boundaries and been consumed by shame?

### ID: p16-10
How many mornings did we wake up hating ourselves, vowing to never do again what we did last night, only to find ourselves repeat ing the same mistake again just a few hours later?

### ID: p16-11
How many times did we attempt to cure our addictions with therapy, self-help books, cleanses, more exercise, or by changing a job or relationship? How many times did we move, thinking our shadow wouldn’t follow us?

### ID: p16-12
How many promises did we make? How many times did we break those promises?

### ID: p16-13
Having suffered and struggled with addiction in its many forms, we’ve come to understand this first truth as it relates to recov ery: Addiction is suffering. We suffer when we obsess, when we cling and grasp onto all of the delusions of addiction, all the impermanent solutions to our discomfort and pain. We’ve tried to cure our suffering by using the very substances and behaviors that create more discomfort and pain. All our attempts to control our habits demonstrate how we’ve been clinging to the illusion that we can somehow control our experi ences of the world or how others have treated us. We’re still trapped in the prison of suffering. In fact, we’re reinforcing its walls every time we act on our addictions.

### ID: p16-16
Liberation comes when we gain a clear understanding of where our real power lies, and when we are throwing it away. This is a program of empowerment. It’s a path of letting go of behavior that no longer serves us and cultivating that which does.

## Chapter 17: TRAUMA AND ATTACHMENT INJURY

### ID: p17-1
Many of us have experienced trauma, often described as the psy chological damage that occurs after living through an extremely fright ening or distressing event or situation. For some of us, this trauma can be a long-term experience. It’s caused by an overwhelming amount of stress that exceeds our ability to cope, and may make it hard to function even long after the event. Trauma can come from childhood experienc es or from events that occur in our adulthood. It can be sudden, or it can develop over time from a series of events that changed how we per ceive ourselves and the world. This also includes the resulting trauma from discrimination and bigotry. While trauma frequently comes from life-threatening events, any situation that leaves one feeling emotionally or physically in danger can be traumatic. It’s not the objective facts of the event that define the trauma; distress is relative and what might be considered traumatic for one may not be for others. Generally, the more terror and helplessness we feel, the more likely it is we’ll be traumatized.

### ID: p17-2
Attachment injury can be just as insidious and harmful as trau ma, and can have the same impact. It’s defined as an emotional wound to a core relationship with a caregiver, often caused by abuse, neglect, or inconsistency of care in early childhood.

### ID: p17-3
Trauma and attachment injury can impact our recovery and meditation practice in slightly different ways. With trauma we may feel fear (even panic) or distrust when asked to “sit” in meditation, even when intellectually we know we’re in a safe place with a supportive group. It may be triggering to be asked to be present in our bodies and minds, or to focus on our breath. It might also feel unsafe when your identity is uniquely different from the majority of the sangha.

### ID: p17-6
Attachment injury may show up as a hesitation to trust people or a process, as a reluctance to be part of a recovery group or sangha, or as a core belief that we don’t belong. In this case, the nurturing thing to do for ourselves might be to lean into this discomfort, compassionately engage, and investigate the stories we’re telling ourselves about not belonging. Again, it’s key to become aware of the nature of the harm we carry with us. Trauma and attachment injury may require different ways of feeling safe and supported. You should always do whatever is most compassionate for yourself in the moment, and seek outside help when you need it.

### ID: p17-8
Trauma and attachment issues are relevant to suffering and ad diction because they can have a huge impact on our mental and physical health. Studies show that those who struggle with addiction have often experienced trauma at some point in their lives. What we try and use to make us feel better, whether it’s substances or behaviors, often only reinforces the cycle of aversion and craving that will lead to more suf fering. The brain can be overactive when trauma is present because it perceives a very real threat, and the body often responds with feelings of helplessness, fear, and vulnerability. This system can be easily thrown into overdrive when one’s life experience screams: “You’re not safe! Danger! Danger!” Even when the danger is no longer present.

### ID: p17-9
For some people, post-traumatic symptoms may be increasingly severe and last long after the original events have ended. Many of us have intrusive thoughts that seem to come out of the blue, or we feel confusion or mood swings we can’t link to specific events. Traumatic responses may lead us to avoid activities or places that trigger memories of the event. We can become socially isolated and withdrawn, and lose interest in things we used to enjoy. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may cause us to be easily startled, edgy, have impaired function during sex or other activities, or unusually alert to potential danger.

### ID: p17-10
Overwhelming fear, anxiety, detachment and isolation, shame, and anger may become background states of our activities. Many other effects of trauma may be triggered by social interactions, work, or medita tion — areas that may be completely disconnected from the original events.

### ID: p17-11
Race-based trauma, as well as trauma from any experience of discrimination or bigotry, can accumulate over a lifetime. When these incidents are considered separately, they might appear manageable, but when experienced cumulatively, they can become extremely difficult to cope with. The distress, fear, and physical body responses that may arise from this kind of trauma often overlap with the symptoms of PTSD.

### ID: p17-13
Trauma and attachment injury can lead to the fear, anger, anx iety, guilt, and loneliness that are common responses to various life ex periences. But, at a deeper level, trauma makes it harder for us to cope in general, to form healthy or safe relationships, to develop an identity in the world, or to defend ourselves. No two of us will react to the same experience in the same way, but this truth points to the fact that certain past experiences can affect our responses later in life. This is key to under standing dukkha, and to meeting our experience with wise-boundaries, compassion, kindness, and courage rather than judgment (for others and ourselves), which is an essential part of recovery.

### ID: p17-14
Many of us turned to addictive substances and behaviors as a way to cope with our trauma. Sometimes running from the pain of our experiences by way of our addictions was itself a survival technique from feeling that we wouldn’t be able to live through the pain of our memories. While this may have provided some temporary relief, it did nothing to actually heal the pain of our trauma, and often led to even more pain.

### ID: p17-15
Our trauma is not our fault, but healing from it is our responsi bility, and our right. Developing understanding and compassion toward the way trauma affects our reactions to events or circumstances in the present moment is an important part of that healing.

## Chapter 18: INQUIRY OF THE FIRST NOBLE TRUTH:

### ID: p18-1
#### Class: inquirybullitt

## Chapter 19: THE SECOND NOBLE TRUTH:
### ID: p19-1
#### Class: subtitle
The Cause of Suffering

### ID: p19-2
As people who have become dependent on substances and be haviors, we’ve all experienced the sense of failure and hopelessness that comes from trying, and failing, to let go of our fixations. Addiction itself increases our suffering by creating a hope that both pleasure and escape can be permanent. We go through this suffering again and again because substances or behaviors can only give us temporary relief to our pain, our unhappiness, and our lost or damaged sense of self.

### ID: p19-3
Our refusal to accept the way things are leads to wanting, or crav ing, which is the cause of suffering. This excludes discrimination-based suffering and harm which do not need to be “accepted” but met with wise boundaries, wise action, and compassion. We don’t suffer because of the way things are, but because we want — or think we “need” — those things to be different. We suffer because we cling to the idea that we can satisfy our own cravings, while ignoring the true nature of the world around us. Above all, we cling to the idea that we can hold on to impermanent and unreliable things, things that can’t ever lead to real satisfaction or lasting happiness, without experiencing the suffering of one day losing them.

### ID: p19-5
Clinging to impermanent solutions for suffering results in crav ing. We experience craving like a thirst, an unsatisfied longing, and it can become a driving force in our lives. If craving goes beyond simple desire, which is a natural part of life, it often leads us to fixation, obsession, and the delusional belief that we can’t be happy without getting what we crave. It warps our intentions so that we make choices that harm our selves and others. This repetitive craving and obsessive drive to satisfy it leads to what we now know as addiction. Addiction occupies the part of our mind that chooses — our will — and replaces compassion, kindness, generosity, honesty, and other intentions that might have been there.

### ID: p19-7
Many of us experience addiction as the loss of our freedom to choose; it’s the addiction that seems to be making our choices for us. In the way we “must have” food, shelter, or water, our mind can tell us we “must have” some substance, buy or steal something, satisfy some lust, keep acting until we achieve some “needed” result; that we must protect ourselves at all cost and attack people with whom we dis agree, or people who have something we want. This “need” also leads to an unsettled or agitated state of mind that tells us we’ll only be happy if we get certain results or feel a certain way. We want to be someone we’re not, or we don’t want to be who we are.

### ID: p19-8
Conditions or circumstances in and of themselves don’t cause suffering. They can cause pain or unpleasant experiences, but we add suffering on top of this when we think we “need” those circumstances to be different. We create even more suffering when we act out in ways that deny the reality of the circumstances and the reality of impermanence. Craving is the underlying motive that fuels unwise actions that create suffering.

## Chapter 19.1: INQUIRY OF THE SECOND NOBLE TRUTH:
### ID: p19.1-1
#### Class: inquirybullitt
 
List situations, circumstances, and feelings that you have used harm ful behavior to try to avoid. 
### ID: p19.1-2
#### Class: inquirybullitt

Name the emotions, sensations, and thoughts that come to mind  when you abstain. Are there troubling memories, shame, grief, or  unmet needs behind the craving? How can you meet these with com passion and patience? 
### ID: p19.1-3
#### Class: inquirybullitt
What things did you give up in your clinging to impermanent and  unreliable solutions? For example, did you give up relationships, fi nancial security, health, opportunities, legal standing, or other im portant things to maintain your addictive behaviors? What made the  addiction more important to you than any of these things you gave  up? 
### ID: p19.1-4
#### Class: inquirybullitt
Are you clinging to any beliefs that fuel craving and aversion,  beliefs that deny the truth of impermanence, or beliefs about how  things in life “should” be? What are they?

If you have experienced discrimation-based trauma or social injus tice, how can you meet the experience in a way that honors your  true self, without creating more pain and suffering?


## Chapter 20: THE THIRD NOBLE TRUTH:

### ID: p20-1
#### Class: subtitle
Ending the Suffering

### ID: p20-2
It is possible to end our suffering. When we come to understand the nature of our craving and realize that all our experiences are tempo rary by nature, we can begin a more skillful way to live with the dissat isfaction that is part of being human. We don’t need to be torn apart by our thoughts and feelings that say, “I have to have more of that,” or “I’ll do anything to get rid of this.” The Third Noble Truth states that the end of craving is possible. Each of us has the capacity for recovery.

### ID: p20-3
We are responsible for our own actions and for the energy we give our thoughts and feelings. This means we have some control over how we respond to our own suffering, because the unpleasant emotions take place within us; we create them through our response to experience. We don’t need to depend on anyone or anything else to remove the causes of our suffering. We may not be able to control anything “out there,” but we can learn to choose what we think, say, and do. We come to under stand that if our thoughts, words, and actions are driven by greed, hatred, or confusion, we are creating suffering within suffering. If we let go of these attitudes, we can lessen suffering or even create freedom. We can choose to give up these causes of disturbing and unpleasant emotions. This is the true empowerment and freedom of recovery — recognizing that happiness and suffering are up to us, based on how we choose to respond to our experiences.

## Chapter 20.1: INQUIRY OF THE THIRD NOBLE TRUTH:
### ID: p20.1-1
What makes it so hard to quit? 

### ID: p20.1-2
#### Class: inquirybullitt
What resources are available to help you abstain and recover? 
### ID: p20.1-2
#### Class: inquirybullitt
List reasons to believe you can recover. Also list your doubts. What  might the wise and compassionate part of you — your Buddha na ture — say about these doubts?
### ID: p20.1-2
#### Class: inquirybullitt
Practice “letting go” of something small. Notice that the craving  doesn’t last and that there’s a little sense of relief when you let it pass.  That’s a little taste of freedom.

## Chapter 21.: THE FOURTH NOBLE TRUTH:

The Path

### ID: p21-1
The Buddha taught that by living ethically, practicing medita tion, and developing wisdom and compassion, we can end the suffering we create by resisting, running from, and misunderstanding reality.

### ID: p21-2
The Fourth Noble Truth is the Path that summarizes the es sential elements to recovery, or awakening, and leads to the ending of suffering. It provides an instructive practice for investigating and becom ing aware of the conditioned responses we cling to. These are the eight factors of the Path:
### ID: p21-3

### ID: p21-11
These eight factors can be divided into three groups:
### ID: p21-12
#### Class: bullitt
The Wisdom group of Understanding and Intention. 
### ID: p21-13
#### Class: bullitt
The Ethics group of Speech, Action, and Livelihood. 
### ID: p21-14
#### Class: bullitt
The Concentration group of Effort, Mindfulness, and Concentration.

### ID: p21-15
Each of us will understand and practice each aspect of this Eightfold Path in our own way. We develop our wisdom, ethical practice, and concentration as far as we can in any given moment. As we come to a deeper understanding of the Four Noble Truths, we’re able to bring more effort and concentration to letting go of our greed, hatred, and confusion. Our ethical development will cause us to reflect more deeply on these sources of our unwise actions.


### ID: p21-15
The Eightfold Path is a way of life that each of us follows and practices to the best of our current understanding and capacity. The Path can serve as both a religious and non-religious journey. For many people, their Buddhist practice includes prayer, worship, and ceremony. It is up to you to decide whether to include these practices as part of your recovery path.

## Chapter 22: THE EIGHTFOLD PATH:
### ID: p22-1
We’ve found that it’s useful to make inquiry and investigation a normal part of our everyday routine, especially when we’re feeling un comfortable emotions or facing tough decisions. We can take a moment to pause and sit with what we’re experiencing, identify it, and simply allow it to be, with compassion and without judgment. Then use the Eightfold Path as a guide to go inward and forward by asking ourselves: “How can I apply the Eightfold Path?” It can also be beneficial to use the different sections of the Eightfold Path as an end-of-day reflection.
## Chapter 23: WISE UNDERSTANDING:
### ID: p23-1
As we engage in the world, rather than withdraw from it, we can use Wise Understanding to live without clinging, attachment, or craving. By paying attention to our actions and the results of those actions, we can begin to change where our choices are leading. If we intend to act in ways that have positive results, and if we’re aware of the true intention and the nature of our actions, then we’ll see better results — better meaning less suffering and less harm.

### ID: p23-2
The word karma in Sanskrit translates to “what our actions cre ate.” Any intentional act — mental, verbal, or physical — is a kind of karma. Skillful or wise actions strengthen our sense of balance, kindness, compassion, loving, and equanimity. When we act unskillfully or un wisely — when we steal, lie, take advantage of somebody else, or cause intentional harm based on our own craving or delusions — it creates an immediate sense of imbalance. It fights with our intention to avoid harming others. Karma is determined by our intention and applies to any volitional or purposeful action. The result of our volitional actions may be an increase in our happiness or may lead to additional suffering. There is no actor apart from action, and there is no action without intention.

### ID: p23-3
Unskillful actions leave us less able to meet the next challenge or pain we face. For example, when we steal, we have to immediately justify to ourselves why our greed was more important than the harm we caused by taking. We must create a cover story, hide our actions, and adjust to the fear of getting caught. Ultimately, if the theft gets discovered, we might have to deal with financial or legal consequences, or face a lack of trust from our community. Similarly, when we’re dishonest, we immediately focus energy on maintaining the untruth. We must emotionally carry the potential pain that is caused to others, and ourselves, if the lie is revealed.

### ID: p23-4
This understanding of karma rests on the insight that we are responsible for our own happiness and misery, and there is a cause to every experience of happiness or misery. From a Buddhist point of view, our choices — which are dependent on our present mental, moral, intellectual, and emotional conditions — decide the effects of our actions. If we act skillfully, with understanding and compassion, it’s possible to cause positive, beneficial effects for ourselves and others. If we act with unskillful intention, we cause our own suffering.

### ID: p23-5
This doesn’t mean that we always have control over our experiences. No matter how skillfully we act, the external world — people, places, things, societal structures — might not give us what we want. This does not mean we have “bad karma,” or that we’ve failed. It just means that we’re not in control of everything and everyone. The point is that, regardless of what the outside world throws at us, we’re responsible for how we respond to it and how we tend to our internal world. At the end of the day, we have the choice whether we go to bed as somebody who acted wisely and compassionately, or as somebody who didn’t. 
### ID: p23-6
It’s important to note that being responsible for our own hap piness and suffering doesn’t mean we’re responsible for pain inflicted on us by others, or by circumstances out of our control. Many of us have experiences of victimization, oppression, and trauma through no fault of our own. The pain from these experiences should be met with compassion, understanding, and wise boundaries, not minimized, invalidated, or pushed away. In recovery, we learn that we don’t have to add an extra layer of suffering to this pain. We can begin to heal rather than let these experiences or the action of others control and limit us. Without discounting or ignoring the ongoing effects of trauma in our lives, we begin to understand that our responses when that trauma comes up for us, can change our experience of suffering and happiness.

### ID: p23-7
The Buddhist perspective is that our present mental, moral, in tellectual, and emotional circumstances are the direct result of our ac tions and habits, both past and present. How we choose to respond when confronted with pain or discomfort will change our ability to skillfully deal with suffering when it arises. We can also take solace in the fact that we’re not alone, that every person has difficult and unpleasant experienc es. It’s how we respond to pain that determines our experience.

## Chapter 24: WISE INTENTION:

### ID: p24-1
Wise Intention describes the attitude or approach we take to ward ourselves and the world. We can choose non-harming by avoiding actions that have harmful results, detaching from the cravings that seem overwhelming in the moment, and developing a kind and compassionate stance toward ourselves and the world. Wise Intention leads us to stop doing things based on confusion, ill-will, hatred, violence, and selfish ness. It impacts all our relationships: with ourselves, other people, our community, and the world as a whole.

### ID: p24-2
Wise Intention is deciding to act in ways that produce good kar ma and to avoid actions that produce bad karma. We start by looking at the kinds of thoughts that cause us to act in wise or unwise ways. If our thoughts are based on confusion, fear, and greed, then our actions will bring bad results and create harm. If our thoughts are based on generos ity, compassion, and avoiding clinging, then our actions will bring good results. Thoughts that are based in lovingkindness and goodwill, that are free from the desire or intention to cause harm, lead us to act in a beneficial manner.

### ID: p24-3
There may be times when we don’t necessarily want to act in a beneficial manner. We may know the right thing to do, but just don’t want to do it. It’s in these moments we can focus on our intention. May be we aren’t ready to do the difficult thing, to quit a certain behavior, to set a boundary, or forgive someone for whom we hold a resentment. But we can set the intention to do so, and investigate our willingness in meditation by repeating statements like “May I have the willingness to forgive…. May I have the willingness to quit smoking (or skip that piece of cake, or stay off the internet tonight, etc.)…. May I have the willingness to make amends to my partner.”

### ID: p24-5
The first choice we can make in Wise Intention is that of generosity. Generosity teaches us how to let go of our self-centeredness, to let go of clinging to ideas of “mine” and “me.” Selfishness, or self centeredness, is one of the ways we justify and cling to our addictive behaviors. Generosity comes from the awareness that we’re holding on too tightly to our selfishness. The karmic result of looking at the world only through the lens of “me” and “mine” and “what I want” leads to loneliness, sepa ration, and dissatisfaction. Letting go of this clinging can be the solution. Letting go of “me” and “mine” does not mean you need to stop acknowl edging your social identities within your community.

### ID: p24-6
Without generosity, the mind is confined to a small, tight space. Anything that’s not about “me and mine” is off limits. At times in our lives when we become dependent, our world becomes focused on sat isfying our cravings, on holding onto what we want right now. We get sucked into the reactivity of survival mode, believing that we must have our addictive substance or behavior to survive. Our "needs" for relief or pleasure consume us, and we become blind to the needs of those around us. We may even begin to see them as threats.

### ID: p24-7
We can break out of this cycle by opening our hearts: by being present for, and in service to other people. Generosity allows space to re spond to those around us, to include their well-being in our choices. This can, of course, be a tricky concept for those of us who struggle with issues of codependency. Generosity does not mean giving of ourselves without boundaries until we are depleted. It does not mean using “helping” as a form of manipulation to get what we want. Again, what’s important here is that we’re honest about the intention behind our actions.

### ID: p24-8
We try not to confuse intent with impact. Our intention may be to not harm, but sometimes the impact is that someone feels hurt. Many of us have experienced this in our addictions. Without intending to, and often without even being aware of it, we’ve created harm in other people’s lives. The way we choose to practice compassion in recovery is by being accountable when our actions hurt someone, and by acknowledging this hurt without blame or shame, defensiveness or justification. This includes when we offend someone by inadvertently using unwise speech or actions in regards to their social identity, such as race or gender. In these moments, it is important to recognize the difference between intent and impact, and having a deep appreciation and compassion for the interconnectedness among us all.

### ID: p24-9
Generosity allows us to cultivate **appreciative joy**, which is one of the four **heart practices** of Buddhism, along with compassion, lov ingkindness, and equanimity. Joyful appreciation is simply being hap py when somebody else has good fortune, happiness, and peacefulness. Generosity lets us appreciate the happiness of others rather than having feelings of envy, jealousy, or wanting them to be just a bit less happy so we seem a little happier by comparison. We want the other person’s hap piness to increase, for them to become more at peace, and so we learn to appreciate those things in their lives. In the moment of giving, of generosity, we’ve let go of self-centered desire and grasping what is “mine,” or what brings me pleasure. We’re giving up any ill-will or aversion we feel toward the person and toward the world. Instead of creating separation and withdrawal, we’re actively fostering appreciation for the closeness and connectedness of the world.

### ID: p24-10
This is a joy that’s not obstructed by selfish desires, envy, or re sentment. It’s the purity of happiness for someone else’s good fortune. We can choose to cultivate this feeling of joy in the happiness and success of others, without the need to compete or compare. It’s actually a feeling that’s natural to humans, but it’s often neglected when our attention is focused on selfish craving. This is the true seat of generosity: delighting in the happiness of others, without needing anything in return.

### ID: p24-11
The second heart practice is **compassion**, which is first of all a will ingness to come close to pain: to recognize it, honor it, acknowledge it, and respond to it wisely. This isn’t easy, because just as we want to run from or suppress our own pain, we also want to avoid being with the pain of others. Compassion means sitting with our own pain and that of others. It stops the cruelty of indifference. Compassion for ourselves is crucial. Self-compassion is the key to healing the shame and guilt that we often feel as we begin to recognize the harms we caused through our addictions. You may also find that compassion is difficult to realize when it comes to those who have caused you great harm. In these cases, it can be helpful to focus on your own healing by practicing self compassion, engaging in wise reflection of the Four Noble Truths, and committing to the practices of the path. With time, you may gradually wish for the relief of suffering for those who have hurt you.

### ID: p24-12
Compassion is not just offering sympathy and a helping hand. It’s also an intention to avoid causing harm to others and ourselves. This is where we can most easily see the difference between skillful and un skillful actions, and between wise and unwise intentions. Cruelty — and all the harm it creates in the world — comes from a lack of compassion. Cruelty is a desire to cause pain. Compassion is caring about the welfare and happiness of others. Compassion rests on the renunciation of harm ing living beings and is not only the wish, but also the intention to put an end to their suffering. We need to open our hearts — not just our minds — to all the suffering that is experienced in the world. Compassion is not only a feeling: it is an action.

### ID: p24-13
The 3rd heart practice is **lovingkindness**, also known as **metta**. These are thoughts that are free from ill-will, simply wishing that some body else be happy, that they be well, and free from suffering. It’s the choice to consider the well-being of everyone in how we interact with the world. Metta isn’t conditional: it isn’t something we offer only to people we like. We can have concern and care even when we’re feeling our own pain. We can bring metta to mind when we’re faced with difficulty or torn by conflicting feelings about the conditions of life at the moment. Metta doesn’t depend on people acting in a certain way, on our feeling a certain way in the moment, or on the result of our caring. It frees us from only caring about the well-being of others when we think it will lead to some outcome. With metta, we don’t ask the question “Will it do any good to care about this person’s well-being?”

### ID: p24-14
This means that how we think about another person isn’t based on their behavior, or even on the other person at all. How we think about a person is up to us—and if it’s shaped by the practice of metta, then we can care about every person’s well-being, even the most difficult and unpleasant people we know. We can honestly hope that everyone finds a way to be happy without causing harm. Wishing this goodwill towards others frees us from the reactivity and anger that can come when we focus on the person’s behavior or what we think they “ought” to do. We can begin to see the suffering and pain that somebody experiences as a result of their actions, and care about that pain even if it might also lead to pain for us or for others. Our wish is that all beings are free from pain and suffering, that they escape hatred and fear, that they are at ease, and that they find happiness.

### ID: p24-15
Generosity, compassion, and lovingkindness make forgiveness not only possible, but also essential for recovery. Forgiveness rests on understanding and caring about the pain and confusion that give rise to actions that we experience as harmful. We forgive when we focus on the person, rather than the action. We forgive only in the present when our hurt and anger make us aware that our resentment is blocking our own compassionate and generous responses. Forgiveness is not so much something we are giving to the person who hurt us, but something we give to ourselves. It’s centered more on our own conscious intention in how we choose to respond to them. Just as we sometimes act out of fear, greed, or confusion, we see that others do too. Forgiveness doesn’t mean we accept or tolerate harm. It comes from understanding and accepting that the person causing us harm is doing so from a place of pain and confusion. We extend compassion and goodwill to that person, even as we actively try to end the harm. This may mean creating safe boundaries or removing ourselves from exposure to harm. But we do this from a place of compassion and understanding, not resentment.

### ID: p24-16
It is *essential* that we extend the healing of forgiveness and compassion to ourselves. Forgiveness allows us to let go of the guilt and shame of our own harmful actions. We remember that compassion is an action, so when we forgive ourselves we also set an intention not to re-create or continue the harm we have caused to others and to ourselves.

### ID: p24-17
Making amends is an important part of forgiveness. As we begin to gain clarity about the harm we caused in our addiction, we commit to make amends for that harmful behavior. We don’t make amends for the sake of satisfying some external standard of morality, to be forgiven, or to get something in return. Instead, we use the process as a way to let go of our expectations and disappointments in others and ourselves — in other words, to let go of our attachment to a different past.

### ID: p24-18
One of the central principles of karma is realizing that I alone am responsible for the way my past actions impact my current responses to the world. We change our habits by letting go of the past and restoring balance in our relationships. Things we did in the past create patterns of behavior that continue to shape our thoughts and intentions in the present. That process doesn’t stop until we change our relationship with those patterns, and toward the people we’ve harmed. Amends are about restoring the balance in our relationships, not about asking for forgive ness from others. In a sense, it is an action we take to forgive ourselves.

### ID: p24-19
When we have come to understand and face the reality of our impact on others, we begin to understand the purpose of making amends. Practicing compassion leads to a desire to relieve the suffering of people we’ve harmed, and a commitment to not cause further suffering. Even if the person isn’t a part of our lives any longer, it’s possible to acknowledge their hurt and to offer them our goodwill and our remorse. Making amends means we do what we can to remedy the harm or wrong. If that is not possible, we resolve to do some good, not as compensation, but to develop our habits in a different direction. When we intention ally take responsibility for our actions, we let go of harmful avoidance and self-judgment and develop a sense of connectedness, peace, and ease. Amends begin with a willingness to forgive ourselves and take the path of reconciliation: not only with those we have harmed, but also with our own hearts and minds.

### ID: p24-20
Generosity, compassion, lovingkindness, and forgiveness allow us to experience equanimity as we face pain and discomfort, both in ourselves and others. The fourth heart practice is **equanimity**. During our addictions, we often responded to situations that caused us anger, fear, or resentment with a craving that the situations be different. We gave up and surrendered to the negative experience of life. Equanimity does not mean giving up; it is more a quality of leaning in. It is finding peace exactly where we are, regardless of external circumstances. Equanimity allows us to be right in the middle of things, to understand and accept things as they are without needing to escape. When we gave up, we said, “I don’t care what happens.” Equanimity, on the other hand, is being able to say, “I can be present for this.” It’s the acceptance that while there are some things we cannot change, we still have power over how we respond to them. While we don’t always have control over our thoughts and feel ings, we do have power over how we feed them.

## Chapter 25: WISE SPEECH

### ID: p25-1
Wise Speech is based on the intention to do no harm. We’ve all used speech in a manner that may create harm: lying to keep others from knowing what’s really going on; gossiping with the intention of putting someone down or satisfying our desire to be recognized; stealing time and attention by chattering on and on; or trying to convince others to meet our own needs at the expense of their own. Wise Speech includes all the ways we use our voices, including online and in writing.

### ID: p25-2
The basic foundation of Wise Speech is honesty or truthfulness. Dishonesty is exaggeration, minimizing, omitting or lying with the in tention of presenting a distortion of reality. It can take the form of “white lies” to avoid embarrassment or exposure, half-truths to keep from being caught, or seemingly harmless things said at the expense of others. We may say more than we really know to be true in the hopes of appearing smarter or more confident in our position or feeling. Sometimes we say something before we know the truth.

### ID: p25-3
Dishonesty has to do with our intention in speech. Are we moti vated by greed, fear, or confusion? Or are we motivated by a sincere desire to express what’s true, what’s useful, what’s kind, and what’s timely? Wise Speech means we speak with the intention of not causing harm, and of fostering safety and security in our community.

### ID: p25-4
In active addiction, we develop the habit of dishonesty. We lie to cover up or mislead others about the nature and extent of our using or behavior. We lie so we can satisfy the craving our fixation feeds, by hiding our actions, our feelings, or the amount of money and effort we put into satisfying our craving. Many of us lie just for the sake of lying because the truth represents a reality we can’t tolerate. We get trapped by our secrets, and for many of us, having a double life becomes an addiction all its own. This is why honesty is foundational to recovery. Dishonesty is one of the habits that allow our addictive behaviors to flourish. As a result, recovery needs to start with an honest appraisal of exactly what lies we told and what dishonesty we spread during our addictive behavior.

### ID: p25-5
The Buddha provided some guidelines for Wise Speech, in ad dition to truthfulness. He said to avoid slander and gossip, recognizing that such unwise speech causes conflict and makes the community less safe. So, when we talk about others, we can ask ourselves: What’s our intention? Is it to cause division or exclusion? Is it to cause shame or em barrassment in someone else, or to somehow make ourselves look better at somebody else’s expense? It’s possible to talk about other people with the intention of kindness, generosity, and compassion, to seek understanding or support for another. Gossip and slander do not contribute to this and instead, cause harm. Similarly, idle chatter and saying things just to be heard or recognized, or to take up time when we’re uncomfortable, can lead people to dismiss or ignore us and may create impatience and intolerance in our community.

### ID: p25-6
Wise Speech is also reflected in the tone we use when we talk. If we express ourselves in harsh, angry, or abusive ways, we may not be heard even if we’re being truthful. Speaking gently, with the intention of kindness, fosters a community of friendliness and safety. There are always exceptions, of course, and Wise Speech also includes using a loud and strong voice when you need to protect your safety.

### ID: p25-9
It may sound like Wise Speech is primarily about discerning when not to speak, but this isn’t always the case. Many of us grew up in families where it wasn’t safe to talk openly about our thoughts and feelings. Some, because of certain experiences or cultural conditioning, have been taught that we don’t have permission to use our voices or lack the power to speak and be heard. For many of us, practicing Wise Speech may mean learning how to use our voices that have been silenced, and to wisely communicate the needs and boundaries we’ve gotten used to keep ing hidden. At times, this includes speaking up for others when harm is done. Many of us, in an effort to be liked, for fear of rocking the boat, or due to the exhaustion of repeatedly not being seen and heard, have favored being nice over being honest and true to ourselves. Wise Speech teaches us that speaking up, even when it’s hard, is sometimes the best choice, and that speech is never truly kind if we cause harm to ourselves.

### ID: p25-10
Finally, Wise Speech is careful listening. It is also knowing when not to speak when a wise response isn’t available to us. We must listen with compassion, understanding, and receptivity. It can be really helpful to observe how much of the time we spend “listening” to someone else is actually spent judging them or planning what we’re going to say in response. Deep listening — without selfishness, or an agenda — is an act of generosity that lets us build true connection.

## Chapter 26: WISE ACTION

### ID: p26-1
Wise Action is also based in the intention to do no harm and to foster compassion, lovingkindness, generosity, and forgiveness. We try to do what’s skillful, and avoid actions that are unskillful. Wise Action asks that we try to make choices based on understanding and not unthinking habits or ignorance.

### ID: p26-2
The Buddha suggested that we make a commitment to avoid five specific actions that cause harm, a commitment which is known as the Five Precepts. We commit to the Five Precepts as our basic ethical system:
### ID: p26-3
#### Class: numlist
We set the intention to avoid taking the life of another living being,  or from causing harm to ourselves or another living being.
### ID: p26-4

We set the intention to avoid taking what is not freely given, or stealing.

### ID: p26-7
#### Class: numlist
We set the intention to avoid the use of intoxicants and intoxicating  behavior that cloud our awareness. 


### ID: p26-8
We need to continually reflect on and question the intentions behind our actions. We may have moments of clarity, but these can quickly pass, when old habits or thoughts resurface. We commit to con stantly reminding ourselves of our intention to Wise Action: to act in ways that are non-harming.

## Chapter 27: WISE LIVLIHOOD:

### ID: p27-1
The final factor in the ethical group is Wise Livelihood, which  focuses on how we support ourselves in the world. Again, the intent is  to avoid causing harm. For most of us, our work occupies so much of  our time and attention, so how we choose to make a living takes on  special importance. Understanding the principle of karma, and knowing  that unethical activity gives rise to harmful karma, whatever choices or  circumstances lead us to a particular job need to be recognized as having  karmic consequences.
### ID: p27-2
We try to avoid jobs that give rise to suffering and seek work  that does no harm or reduces suffering. The Buddha mentions five kinds  of livelihood to avoid: trading in weapons or instruments of killing, traf ficking in or selling human beings, killing of other beings, making or  selling addictive drugs, or business in poison. We’re encouraged to avoid  occupations based on dishonesty or injury. 
### ID: p27-3
Whatever our job is, we can practice it mindfully, with an in tention of non-harm, of easing suffering, and of compassion. This means  developing an attitude toward our occupation beyond just the money we  make. We can develop an approach of service and caring about the effects  of our actions on others, both within and outside our workspaces. Wise  Livelihood is not about judging ourselves or others for their choice of  work or trying to limit their choices. Instead, we try to understand why  and how we engage in whatever occupation we practice. Whatever work  we do, we can maintain an intention of benefiting others.

## Chapter 28: WISE EFFORT:

### ID: p28-1
Wise Effort is the first of the concentration group. It means  concentrating our effort on understanding and recovery and awakening.  Wise Effort isn’t based on how much we should meditate, how much  service we should do, or how much time we put into healthy activity. Instead, it’s the intention to devote balanced energy to supporting the  other parts of the path, particularly wisdom.
### ID: p28-2
The first thing to pay attention to is avoiding situations and  states of mind that can lead to unethical, unskillful, or harmful respons es. We become more aware of conditions in our lives and investigate our  own responses and reactions to those conditions. When we’re operating  out of greed, ignorance, confusion, or thinking we can get what we want,  we need to be aware of that. We put in the effort and energy to under stand what circumstances allowed these conditions to arise and how we  can begin to move away from those responses. 
### ID: p28-3
Energy or effort is also devoted to letting compassion, lovingk indness, generosity, and forgiveness arise when they’re not present. If we  find ourselves reacting with anger rather than compassion, fear instead  of generosity, blame instead of forgiveness, we can ask how we would  respond if those positive factors were present, and begin to respond more  skillfully. Being hard on ourselves, beating ourselves up, and suffering  from perfectionism are all familiar feelings during addiction and recov ery. When we shame ourselves for not being good enough, not trying  hard enough, not being enough, these are perfect opportunities to prac tice Wise Effort, to reflect on the question, “In this moment, how can I  be kind and gentle with myself?”
### ID: p28-3
In early recovery, we may be most interested in damage control:  simply stopping the destruction and demoralization we have suffered  through our habitual, unskillful responses to craving. We can begin by  awareness of that craving, and learning to make different choices that  don’t trigger the craving. Sometimes awareness is enough; sometimes  that’s all the effort we can muster. As we learn more skillful responses  to our triggers, we gain space to have more compassion, lovingkindness,  generosity, and forgiveness. And as this practice becomes more of a habit,  equanimity and peacefulness begin to replace our habits of grasping and  selfishness. Pacing ourselves is important, alternating periods of activity  and rest. We need to be aware of what our mind, emotions, body, and  recovery can handle right now, and avoid the stress that can come from  pushing ourselves too far, too fast. We need to avoid those things that  put us into unskillful mind-states, and try to do things that return us to  a more easeful way of being in the present moment.
### ID: p28-4
Try to remember that whatever your experience is right now,  it will pass. Remind yourself that you don’t really know how long an  unpleasant or painful experience will last. Try to be open to recognizing  and investigating the experience while it is present, without interpreting it as a permanent part of your experience. Recognizing that the craving,  experience, or thought will pass makes it easier to avoid the impulse to  make an immediate, unskillful response.

## Chapter 29: WISE MINDFULNESS:
### ID: p29-1
Mindfulness — being present to what’s going on in our minds,  bodies, hearts, and world — is central to the practice of the Eightfold  Path. We learn to be present for the way things are with compassion,  without judging them or ourselves. Mindfulness is being aware of what ever is present, noticing it, and letting it pass. It’s also remembering that  we’re on a path leading to our freedom and long-lasting happiness. 
### ID: p29-2
Mindfulness asks us to be aware and to investigate, without the  reactivity and grasping for control that leads to suffering. We learn to  stay attentive to what’s happening without having to either react to or  deny what’s happening. For many of us, our addictions prevented us  from being mindful. In fact, that was often the whole point: we used our  substances and behaviors to avoid feeling, to avoid being aware, because  being aware was painful. But by trying to avoid pain, we often creat ed more suffering. We’re now making a different choice — to sit with  the discomfort rather than pushing it away or trying to numb it. We  can learn to sit with the discomfort in different ways, either by bringing awareness to the physical sensations that affect our bodies or in a more  distant, non-attached way, such as naming the emotions while allowing  them to arise and cease. We’re choosing to respond to it with mindful  investigation and compassion, and to trust that it will pass if we let it.  We’re remembering that there’s another way to respond to the difficulties  of life. 
### ID: p29-3
Our minds can get lost in how we react to experiences. When  something happens, we almost immediately begin to create a story, plan,  or fantasy about it. We have a thought about an experience, that thought  leads to another, and on and on until we’re far from a real understanding of the experience itself. Mindfulness is noticing the experience in  that moment before we get lost in the judgment of the moment or the  stories we spin about it. Rather than blindly following our reactions and  responses to an experience, mindfulness allows us the space to choose to  respond skillfully and from a place of wisdom and morality. 
### ID: p29-4
Mindfulness encourages us to be open to and investigate the  painful experiences (and our habitual reactions to those experiences),  rather than to deny, ignore, suppress, or run from them. Most of us have  been conditioned to be our own harshest critic from early on, especially  during our fixations on substances and behaviors. We carry the shadow  of that judgment with us, even as we seek recovery, giving ourselves nega 
tive feedback and scrutinizing every effort we make, holding ourselves to  impossible standards of perfection. Letting go of that inner critic allows  us to be mindful in the present of the efforts we are making, mindful of  the compassion and lovingkindness we’re learning to make a part of our  practice and our lives. Remember that we often talk way more harshly to  ourselves than we ever would to somebody else. It’s useful to notice when  we’re treating ourselves too harshly, and then shift attention to what we are doing well. We can acknowledge the negative thought, and then gen tly let it go. 
### ID: p29-5
Mindfulness practice is based on the Satipatthana Sutta, or the **four foundations of mindfulness**. The 1st foundation, **mindfulness of the body**, asks us to bring awareness, attention, or focus on our breath  and to bodily sensations. Meditations on the breath and body are focused on this awareness. The 2nd foundation is **mindfulness of feeling and feeling tones**. This practice involves noticing the emotional tone — pleasure or displeasure — that comes with every sensation, even when the  sensation is a thought. It also encourages us to notice when a sensation  is neither pleasant nor unpleasant but feels neutral. For example, we can  experience inhales and exhales by noticing where in our body we feel the breath most directly. The second foundation instructs us to notice those  sensations that are neutral, as well as those that are pleasant or unpleasant. 
### ID: p29-6
The third foundation, **mindfulness of the mind**, asks us to notice  when attachment — also known as greed or wanting — comes up, and  to be aware that attachment arises in the mind. We also learn to notice  when the mind is not attached to a particular thought or sensation. The  same practice of noticing applies when we become aware of aversion,  which we can experience as resistance or even hatred. When aversion isn’t present in the mind, we can notice that the mind is free from aversion. 
### ID: p29-7
In the fourth foundation of mindfulness, **mindfulness of dhammas**, we begin to simply notice when a thought arises, being aware of it  without judgment or evaluation, and allowing it to pass away without  holding onto it and without creating a story out of it. Training in the  fourth foundation lets us be aware of thoughts arising and passing away,  and realizing each will pass when we let go. 
### ID: p29-8
Two simple practices can make mindfulness a part of our daily lives. First, we can stop whatever we’re doing at any moment, and pay attention to the physical sensation of three in-breaths and three out breaths. This simple practice grounds our attention in what’s present  right now, rather than in the voices and critics we carry with us. Shift ing from the stories and judgments we constantly create during the day  to this simple grounding practice of three breaths gives us the space we sometimes need to return to mindfulness of the present moment.
### ID: p29-9
A second practice is to take time to inquire into the truthful ness of the negative or difficult messages we give ourselves. First, take  time to ask yourself whether the message is true. Second, ask how sure  you are that it’s true. Are you absolutely certain about what may seem like  an easy or automatic truth? Third, notice how you feel when you believe  the thought: Does it lead to fear, anger, sadness, desire? Finally, reflect on  who you’d be without the thought. How would you feel if you weren’t  caught up in the particular mindset or scenario you’re creating?

## Chapter 30: WISE CONCENTRATION:
### ID: p30-1
The final aspect of the Eightfold Path is Wise Concentration.  Meditation practice begins with concentrating on the breath, the body,  the emotional tone of the moment, and the processes of the mind, be cause these things exist in the present moment. If we focus on breath,  for example, we’re paying attention to the present moment because our  breathing is immediate: it’s happening right now. Breathing is a natural  process that doesn’t require judgment or interpretation, and so it eases  the mind from the need to react.
### ID: p30-2
The purpose of concentration is to train the mind to be focused  and undistracted. Most of us, early in meditation practice, are distracted  by things around us; like a noise outside the room, a pain or discomfort  in our bodies, our own worries or judgments of the experience, bore 
dom or weariness, or thoughts and plans. These distractions can lead to  a feeling of unease or restlessness. This is perfectly normal. In our addic tions, we nurtured the habit of distracting ourselves and for many of us,  it became a survival technique. Concentration meditation gives us the  opportunity to meet this habit with kindness and patience rather than  resistance.
### ID: p30-3
Concentration, like the rest of the factors of the Eightfold Path,  is a practice. As with any practice, it takes time and effort to learn a new way to focus attention. In meditation, simply noting the distraction, accepting that it exists, and then refocusing our mind back to the object of concentration, is the practice. If we become focused on discomfort, thoughts, or plans, we need to first recognize that it’s happening, and  then become curious about it. Then we can make the choice to refocus —  to concentrate on the object of the meditation. Our habitual patterns can  seduce us into thinking we’re doing it wrong, into judging our practice, or into giving up. Don’t let them. When we observe what the mind is  telling us and react with compassion, knowing we have the power to  recognize it and refocus it, we strengthen our ability to concentrate. 
### ID: p30-4
Concentration can be especially helpful in times of craving. In stead of getting lost in the delusion that we must have what we’re craving,  we can trust that the craving is only temporary and refocus our attention  on our intention to act wisely. This may simply be the three-breath pause  mentioned earlier, or a more formal sitting meditation concentrating on  the breath. We can use concentration meditation to train our minds to  focus on a helpful thought in the midst of temporary discomfort and  the yearning for a quick fix. This may take the form of repeated phrases  to focus and clear the mind, such as metta, compassion, or equanimity  meditations. It could also take the form of prayer, chanting, a self-affirmation, a mantra, or another form of focused attention. Concentration  practices can often bring a sense of well-being and peace in a time of tur moil. They’re a healthy way to return to a balanced, resilient state when  we’re stressed or agitated. 
### ID: p30-5
Sometimes when cravings or unpleasant emotions are particular ly strong, moving the body can be the best way to help refocus our energy  and find relief. Concentration at those times may mean being focused  and mindful about each movement we are making: this is my foot taking  a step, this is my hand reaching for the cup. After a few minutes of concen tration practice, of not giving energy to our craving or obsession, we may  find the intensity of the feeling has passed. The more we do this, the more  we gain confidence that we have the power to relieve the suffering of our  addiction through following this path and committing to this practice.
### ID: p30-6
For trauma survivors, the breath, the heart, and the mind can be  potentially overwhelming places to place the attention. So if traditional  anchors like breath and body are challenging, ask yourself: What helps  you stay present? What helps to calm your nervous system? It might be  feeling the floor beneath you, or holding a stone, or looking at a piece  of art on the wall. All that you need to be present is to pay attention to  something happening right now. 
### ID: p30-7
If you feel powerful emotions begin to arise during meditation,  there are some simple things you can do to remain present. For example,  you can open your eyes rather than keeping them closed, or give yourself  permission to back off from the practice you are working on. Do whatever you need to do to take care of yourself should such a state arise, wheth er that is taking some deep breaths, putting a name on your experience  (such as “flashback”), or silently repeating some compassionate phrases to yourself. Learning to turn our attention back and forth between challenging sensations and our own supportive resources is a valuable skill  that professionals call titration. You can be gentle with your practice as  you are working to develop this skill.

# Section 5: Truths and Paths

## Chapter 12: AWAKENING: BUDDHA


### ID: p12-2
Most of us enter recovery with one goal in mind: to stop the suffering that got us here in the first place, whether that was drinking, using drugs, stealing, eating, gambling, sex, codependency, technology, or other process addictions. As newcomers, most of us would be satisfied with simple damage control or reduction in harmful behavior. We want to stop hurting ourselves or others in particular ways.

### ID: p12-3
You’re reading this because there is a spark of wisdom in you that desires to seek the end of the suffering of your addiction. You’ve already taken the first step on the path to your own awakening. Everyone who has made the wise intention to recover, wherever they are on their path, has accessed that pure, wise part of themselves that the wreckage of addiction can never touch.

### ID: p12-5
So many of us have hearts that are still in pain from the suffering we’ve experienced. Some have undergone trauma which often led us to seek temporary relief in our addictive behavior which unintentionally added more suffering to our original wounds. We tried to protect our selves by running from the pain, putting on a mask, and pushing people away for fear of being vulnerable, all to adapt to what often feels like a hostile world.

### ID: p12-7
We start to recover when we let ourselves believe in and rediscover our pure, radiant, and courageous heart where we find our potential for awakening resides. Who were we before the world got to us? Who are we beyond the obsession of our conditioned minds? Who are we beneath all our walls and heartbreak? Despite the trauma, addiction, fear, and shame, there is a still and centered part of us that remains whole. There is a part of us that’s not traumatized, that’s not addicted, that’s not ruled by fear or shame. This is where wisdom comes from, and it’s the foundation of our recovery.

### ID: p12-8
If you’re at the beginning of your recovery journey, it may seem impossible to access this part of you. But you’re here because you already have. Perhaps you felt some small glimmer of hope — maybe born out of desperation — that there might be a way out, that things could change if you took wise action and reached out for help. Maybe it feels impossible to have faith in this part of you, to believe that you have the potential to be capable of wisdom and kindness and ethical deeds, to believe you can be the source of your own healing and awakening. Recovery is a gradual process. This path is a lifetime of individual steps. It’s not only the Bud dha’s example that shows us the way, but also those before us who have gone through the process of recovery and made it to the other side.
They show us that we can, too.


### ID: p12-11
So what does the Buddha have to do with recovery?

### ID: p12-12
There are two ways in which we use the word Buddha, which means “awakened.” First, it is the title given to Siddhartha Gautama, a prince who lived in modern-day Nepal and India roughly 2,500 years ago. After many years of scholarly study, meditation, and ethical practice, he was awakened to the nature of human suffering and discovered a path that leads to the end of suffering, and the freedom that comes from awakening. After his awakening, Siddhartha came to be known as the Buddha. The second use of the word Buddha follows from the first. Bud dha can refer, not only to the historical figure but also to the idea of awakening: the fact that each of us has within ourselves the potential to awaken to the same understanding as the original Buddha. When we take refuge in the Buddha, we take refuge not in Siddhartha as a person, but in the fact that he was able to find freedom from his suffering and so can we.

## Chapter 13: THE STORY OF THE ORIGINAL BUDDHA

### ID: p13-1
To understand the nature of this awakening it could help to know something about the life of Siddhartha Gautama. One of the many versions of the story of the Buddha tells us that Siddhartha was a wealthy prince, born into privilege, and sheltered from much of the suffering of the world. The story goes that young Siddhartha sneaked away from his palace and saw people suffering from old age, sick ness, and death. He realized that no amount of privilege could protect him from this suffering. Wealth wouldn’t prevent it. Comfort wouldn’t prevent it. Pleasure wouldn’t prevent it. Despite having a life of ease, Sid dhartha still found that he experienced suffering and dissatisfaction. He was born with everything, but it wasn’t enough.

### ID: p13-2
This persistent dissatisfaction with life, whether dramatic or subtle, is called dukkha, a Pali word we still use today. All humans ex perience dukkha, but some of us — particularly those of us who have struggled with addiction — seem to experience it on a more intense level, and with worse consequences.

### ID: p13-3
What is addiction but the consistent and nagging feeling of “not enough?” What is addiction other than being constantly unsatisfied? 

### ID: p13-4
Siddhartha saw that pain was an unavoidable part of life, and he became determined to find a way to put an end to it. He left his family and for a time, lived the life of an ascetic — the extreme opposite to his previous life of comfort and wealth. As an ascetic, he sat in extremely un comfortable postures meditating for long periods of time. He slept very
little. He ate very little. He even tried breathing very little. He thought that, since material comfort hadn’t eliminated suffering, maybe the oppo site of material comfort would. At the brink of death, Siddhartha aban doned the idea of extreme asceticism and instead chose what he called “the middle path.”

### ID: p13-6
Siddhartha realized that both the extremes of pleasure and denial of pleasure had brought him nowhere nearer to liberation. Neither extreme had given relief from his suffering. So he set off on his own to meditate. Sitting beneath a Bodhi tree, he meditated deeply and discovered the path that leads to the end of suffering. He looked within himself for his own liberation, and he found it.

### ID: p13-7
What Siddhartha understood as he meditated under the Bodhi tree is known as the **Dharma**, or the “Truth,” which explains the causes and nature of cyclical suffering. It’s the basis of the teachings of Bud dhism. Central to this path are the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, which will be explained in the next chapter.

### ID: p13-8
Siddhartha was called the Buddha, or “The One Who Woke Up,” because most people go through life with a false sense of reality, like being in a trance. The Buddha spent the rest of his life developing the Dharma into a simple but sophisticated system. He shared it with anyone who would listen, dedicating himself to a life of service to free everybody from suffering. He defied the norms of his time by letting women and the poorest class of citizens become monastics. Everyone was welcome in his sangha, his spiritual community. Central to his teachings was the idea that liberation is available to all — to the most broken and oppressed among us, to the sick, to the powerless, to those who have lost everything, to those who have nothing left to lose. All of us, even the most addicted, the most lost, can find our way to awakening, because we all have the ability to access the pure, wise, and true nature within each of us.

## Chapter 14: WALKING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE BUDDHA

### ID: p14-1
The story of the Buddha may seem far removed from our every day reality, but his life before and after his awakening offers us a model for our own lives. All of us can relate to the inevitability of suffering. Aging, sickness, and death have touched us all. We’ve experienced the truth of impermanence — the highs we achieved in our addictions al ways wore off, but we kept chasing them anyway. We’ve also endured other forms of suffering, some self-inflicted and some at the hands of others. And we’ve dealt with subtle forms of dukkha: the annoyances, the boredom, the loss of what we want, the inability to keep what we have, the impatience with life, the refusal to accept what is. And what have we done with these experiences of suffering?

### ID: p14-4
At this point most of our stories start to look different from Siddhartha’s, and this difference is what led us here. Instead of sitting with our suffering, we found ways to change it, avoid it, or replace it with something more pleasurable. For some of us, that came in the form of drinking or using drugs. Others used sex, relationships, food, 
self-harming, technology, work, or gambling. And some of our stories contain a version of “all of the above.” Whatever the behavior, it was just a tempo rary solution that always led to deeper suffering for ourselves and others.

### ID: p14-6
We’ve come to realize that our stories don’t have to continue like this. The life of Siddhartha, and the lives of the countless people we meet in recovery who have found an end to the suffering of addiction, prove to us that there is another way.

### ID: p14-7
We can look back on our own lives and see clearly the path that brought us here. We can examine our own actions and intentions and come to understand how we shape our own future. And we can gain insight into the nature of our own suffering and follow a path that leads to less harm and less suffering.

### ID: p14-8
The Buddha began as a layperson with suffering, just like us. This is not a path of miracle or blind-faith. This is a path of practice and the Buddha can be an ideal that inspires us. Experience has shown us that good results come when we put the necessary effort into our own recovery. This is a program of empowerment: we take responsibility for our own intentions and actions. The Sangha is here to help us along the way. We don’t have to identify as Buddhists, and we don’t have to meditate for hours each day. But we have found that the path outlined in the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path can lead us to liberation from both the suffering of addiction and the suffering that comes from simply being human. We trust in the potential in all of us to find freedom from this suffering.


## Chapter 15: THE TRUTH: DHARMA


### ID: p15-2
As people who have struggled with addiction, we’re already inti mately familiar with the truth of suffering. Even if we’ve never heard of the Buddha, at some level we already understand the core of the teach ings: that in this life, there is suffering.

### ID: p15-3
It can be incredibly liberating to hear this said so plainly and directly. No one is trying to convince or convert us. No one is telling us we have to believe something. No one is sugarcoating our experience.

### ID: p15-4
The Buddha also taught the way to free ourselves from this suf fering. When the Buddha awakened, he understood how samsāra, or the cycle of existence, came to be and how it is maintained. The heart of these teachings (which we call the Dharma) is the Four Noble Truths. These four truths, and the corresponding commitments, are the foundation of our program:

### ID: p15-5

## Chapter 16: THE FIRST NOBLE TRUTH:

### ID: p16-1
#### Class: subtitle
There is Suffering

### ID: p16-2
Some of the ways in which we may experience suffering are obvi ous, like poverty, hunger, pain, disappointment, and feeling separated or excluded. There is also suffering due to the divisions of our world, such as war, colonization, and oppression. Some are less obvious, like feelings of cravings, anxiety, stress, and uncertainty. We also suffer as we struggle with birth, aging, sickness, and death. As much as we want to avoid what we consider unpleasant and hold onto what we label as pleasant, dissatis faction, separation, loss, and injustice still may frequently arise. Suffering occurs whenever we fail to see the true nature of our existence, when we insist on controlling or altering our reality.

### ID: p16-3
The First Noble Truth rests on the understanding that our lives seem unsatisfactory because experiences are impermanent and impersonal. Our senses (which the Buddha understood to include not just hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touch, but also thinking) are often unreli able and temporary, which means that the way we experience and make sense of the world is constantly changing and subjective. We suffer be cause we keep expecting these temporary experiences to be permanent and absolute, and to satisfy our craving for pleasure or to avoid pain. 

### ID: p16-4
Many of us have suffered by trying and failing to control our dependencies, habits, and addictions. We’ve used every kind of willpow er, bargaining, planning, and magical thinking; each time imagining the result would be different, and blaming ourselves when it turned out the same.

### ID: p16-7
How many times did we promise: “Just this one last time, then I’m done? I’ll just use or drink on the weekends, or only after work, or only on special occasions. I’ll never drink in the morning. I won’t do the hard stuff. I’ll never get high alone. I’ll never use at work or around my family. I’ll never drink and drive. I’ll never use needles.”

### ID: p16-8
How many diets have we tried? How many times have we said we wouldn’t binge, or purge, or restrict calories, or over-exercise? How many times have we looked at the scars on our arms and vowed to never cut again? How many times have we let our wounds heal, only to break them open once more?

### ID: p16-9
How many limits have we set on ourselves around technology or work, only to get pulled back in? How many times have we vowed to have no more one-night stands, vowed to stay away from certain people or places or websites? How many times have we crossed our own boundaries and been consumed by shame?

### ID: p16-10
How many mornings did we wake up hating ourselves, vowing to never do again what we did last night, only to find ourselves repeat ing the same mistake again just a few hours later?

### ID: p16-11
How many times did we attempt to cure our addictions with therapy, self-help books, cleanses, more exercise, or by changing a job or relationship? How many times did we move, thinking our shadow wouldn’t follow us?

### ID: p16-12
How many promises did we make? How many times did we break those promises?

### ID: p16-13
Having suffered and struggled with addiction in its many forms, we’ve come to understand this first truth as it relates to recov ery: Addiction is suffering. We suffer when we obsess, when we cling and grasp onto all of the delusions of addiction, all the impermanent solutions to our discomfort and pain. We’ve tried to cure our suffering by using the very substances and behaviors that create more discomfort and pain. All our attempts to control our habits demonstrate how we’ve been clinging to the illusion that we can somehow control our experi ences of the world or how others have treated us. We’re still trapped in the prison of suffering. In fact, we’re reinforcing its walls every time we act on our addictions.

### ID: p16-16
Liberation comes when we gain a clear understanding of where our real power lies, and when we are throwing it away. This is a program of empowerment. It’s a path of letting go of behavior that no longer serves us and cultivating that which does.

## Chapter 17: TRAUMA AND ATTACHMENT INJURY

### ID: p17-1
Many of us have experienced trauma, often described as the psy chological damage that occurs after living through an extremely fright ening or distressing event or situation. For some of us, this trauma can be a long-term experience. It’s caused by an overwhelming amount of stress that exceeds our ability to cope, and may make it hard to function even long after the event. Trauma can come from childhood experienc es or from events that occur in our adulthood. It can be sudden, or it can develop over time from a series of events that changed how we per ceive ourselves and the world. This also includes the resulting trauma from discrimination and bigotry. While trauma frequently comes from life-threatening events, any situation that leaves one feeling emotionally or physically in danger can be traumatic. It’s not the objective facts of the event that define the trauma; distress is relative and what might be considered traumatic for one may not be for others. Generally, the more terror and helplessness we feel, the more likely it is we’ll be traumatized.

### ID: p17-2
Attachment injury can be just as insidious and harmful as trau ma, and can have the same impact. It’s defined as an emotional wound to a core relationship with a caregiver, often caused by abuse, neglect, or inconsistency of care in early childhood.

### ID: p17-3
Trauma and attachment injury can impact our recovery and meditation practice in slightly different ways. With trauma we may feel fear (even panic) or distrust when asked to “sit” in meditation, even when intellectually we know we’re in a safe place with a supportive group. It may be triggering to be asked to be present in our bodies and minds, or to focus on our breath. It might also feel unsafe when your identity is uniquely different from the majority of the sangha.

### ID: p17-6
Attachment injury may show up as a hesitation to trust people or a process, as a reluctance to be part of a recovery group or sangha, or as a core belief that we don’t belong. In this case, the nurturing thing to do for ourselves might be to lean into this discomfort, compassionately engage, and investigate the stories we’re telling ourselves about not belonging. Again, it’s key to become aware of the nature of the harm we carry with us. Trauma and attachment injury may require different ways of feeling safe and supported. You should always do whatever is most compassionate for yourself in the moment, and seek outside help when you need it.

### ID: p17-8
Trauma and attachment issues are relevant to suffering and ad diction because they can have a huge impact on our mental and physical health. Studies show that those who struggle with addiction have often experienced trauma at some point in their lives. What we try and use to make us feel better, whether it’s substances or behaviors, often only reinforces the cycle of aversion and craving that will lead to more suf fering. The brain can be overactive when trauma is present because it perceives a very real threat, and the body often responds with feelings of helplessness, fear, and vulnerability. This system can be easily thrown into overdrive when one’s life experience screams: “You’re not safe! Danger! Danger!” Even when the danger is no longer present.

### ID: p17-9
For some people, post-traumatic symptoms may be increasingly severe and last long after the original events have ended. Many of us have intrusive thoughts that seem to come out of the blue, or we feel confusion or mood swings we can’t link to specific events. Traumatic responses may lead us to avoid activities or places that trigger memories of the event. We can become socially isolated and withdrawn, and lose interest in things we used to enjoy. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may cause us to be easily startled, edgy, have impaired function during sex or other activities, or unusually alert to potential danger.

### ID: p17-10
Overwhelming fear, anxiety, detachment and isolation, shame, and anger may become background states of our activities. Many other effects of trauma may be triggered by social interactions, work, or medita tion — areas that may be completely disconnected from the original events.

### ID: p17-11
Race-based trauma, as well as trauma from any experience of discrimination or bigotry, can accumulate over a lifetime. When these incidents are considered separately, they might appear manageable, but when experienced cumulatively, they can become extremely difficult to cope with. The distress, fear, and physical body responses that may arise from this kind of trauma often overlap with the symptoms of PTSD.

### ID: p17-13
Trauma and attachment injury can lead to the fear, anger, anx iety, guilt, and loneliness that are common responses to various life ex periences. But, at a deeper level, trauma makes it harder for us to cope in general, to form healthy or safe relationships, to develop an identity in the world, or to defend ourselves. No two of us will react to the same experience in the same way, but this truth points to the fact that certain past experiences can affect our responses later in life. This is key to under standing dukkha, and to meeting our experience with wise-boundaries, compassion, kindness, and courage rather than judgment (for others and ourselves), which is an essential part of recovery.

### ID: p17-14
Many of us turned to addictive substances and behaviors as a way to cope with our trauma. Sometimes running from the pain of our experiences by way of our addictions was itself a survival technique from feeling that we wouldn’t be able to live through the pain of our memories. While this may have provided some temporary relief, it did nothing to actually heal the pain of our trauma, and often led to even more pain.

### ID: p17-15
Our trauma is not our fault, but healing from it is our responsi bility, and our right. Developing understanding and compassion toward the way trauma affects our reactions to events or circumstances in the present moment is an important part of that healing.

## Chapter 19: THE SECOND NOBLE TRUTH:
### ID: p19-1
#### Class: subtitle
The Cause of Suffering

### ID: p19-2
As people who have become dependent on substances and be haviors, we’ve all experienced the sense of failure and hopelessness that comes from trying, and failing, to let go of our fixations. Addiction itself increases our suffering by creating a hope that both pleasure and escape can be permanent. We go through this suffering again and again because substances or behaviors can only give us temporary relief to our pain, our unhappiness, and our lost or damaged sense of self.

### ID: p19-3
Our refusal to accept the way things are leads to wanting, or crav ing, which is the cause of suffering. This excludes discrimination-based suffering and harm which do not need to be “accepted” but met with wise boundaries, wise action, and compassion. We don’t suffer because of the way things are, but because we want — or think we “need” — those things to be different. We suffer because we cling to the idea that we can satisfy our own cravings, while ignoring the true nature of the world around us. Above all, we cling to the idea that we can hold on to impermanent and unreliable things, things that can’t ever lead to real satisfaction or lasting happiness, without experiencing the suffering of one day losing them.

### ID: p19-5
Clinging to impermanent solutions for suffering results in crav ing. We experience craving like a thirst, an unsatisfied longing, and it can become a driving force in our lives. If craving goes beyond simple desire, which is a natural part of life, it often leads us to fixation, obsession, and the delusional belief that we can’t be happy without getting what we crave. It warps our intentions so that we make choices that harm our selves and others. This repetitive craving and obsessive drive to satisfy it leads to what we now know as addiction. Addiction occupies the part of our mind that chooses — our will — and replaces compassion, kindness, generosity, honesty, and other intentions that might have been there.

### ID: p19-7
Many of us experience addiction as the loss of our freedom to choose; it’s the addiction that seems to be making our choices for us. In the way we “must have” food, shelter, or water, our mind can tell us we “must have” some substance, buy or steal something, satisfy some lust, keep acting until we achieve some “needed” result; that we must protect ourselves at all cost and attack people with whom we dis agree, or people who have something we want. This “need” also leads to an unsettled or agitated state of mind that tells us we’ll only be happy if we get certain results or feel a certain way. We want to be someone we’re not, or we don’t want to be who we are.

### ID: p19-8
Conditions or circumstances in and of themselves don’t cause suffering. They can cause pain or unpleasant experiences, but we add suffering on top of this when we think we “need” those circumstances to be different. We create even more suffering when we act out in ways that deny the reality of the circumstances and the reality of impermanence. Craving is the underlying motive that fuels unwise actions that create suffering.

## Chapter 20: THE THIRD NOBLE TRUTH:

### ID: p20-1
#### Class: subtitle
Ending the Suffering

### ID: p20-2
It is possible to end our suffering. When we come to understand the nature of our craving and realize that all our experiences are tempo rary by nature, we can begin a more skillful way to live with the dissat isfaction that is part of being human. We don’t need to be torn apart by our thoughts and feelings that say, “I have to have more of that,” or “I’ll do anything to get rid of this.” The Third Noble Truth states that the end of craving is possible. Each of us has the capacity for recovery.

### ID: p20-3
We are responsible for our own actions and for the energy we give our thoughts and feelings. This means we have some control over how we respond to our own suffering, because the unpleasant emotions take place within us; we create them through our response to experience. We don’t need to depend on anyone or anything else to remove the causes of our suffering. We may not be able to control anything “out there,” but we can learn to choose what we think, say, and do. We come to under stand that if our thoughts, words, and actions are driven by greed, hatred, or confusion, we are creating suffering within suffering. If we let go of these attitudes, we can lessen suffering or even create freedom. We can choose to give up these causes of disturbing and unpleasant emotions. This is the true empowerment and freedom of recovery — recognizing that happiness and suffering are up to us, based on how we choose to respond to our experiences.

The Path

### ID: p21-1
The Buddha taught that by living ethically, practicing medita tion, and developing wisdom and compassion, we can end the suffering we create by resisting, running from, and misunderstanding reality.

### ID: p21-2
The Fourth Noble Truth is the Path that summarizes the es sential elements to recovery, or awakening, and leads to the ending of suffering. It provides an instructive practice for investigating and becom ing aware of the conditioned responses we cling to. These are the eight factors of the Path:

The Ethics group of Speech, Action, and Livelihood. 
### ID: p21-14
#### Class: bullitt
The Concentration group of Effort, Mindfulness, and Concentration.

### ID: p21-15
Each of us will understand and practice each aspect of this Eightfold Path in our own way. We develop our wisdom, ethical practice, and concentration as far as we can in any given moment. As we come to a deeper understanding of the Four Noble Truths, we’re able to bring more effort and concentration to letting go of our greed, hatred, and confusion. Our ethical development will cause us to reflect more deeply on these sources of our unwise actions.


### ID: p21-15
The Eightfold Path is a way of life that each of us follows and practices to the best of our current understanding and capacity. The Path can serve as both a religious and non-religious journey. For many people, their Buddhist practice includes prayer, worship, and ceremony. It is up to you to decide whether to include these practices as part of your recovery path.

## Chapter 22: THE EIGHTFOLD PATH:
### ID: p22-1
We’ve found that it’s useful to make inquiry and investigation a normal part of our everyday routine, especially when we’re feeling un comfortable emotions or facing tough decisions. We can take a moment to pause and sit with what we’re experiencing, identify it, and simply allow it to be, with compassion and without judgment. Then use the Eightfold Path as a guide to go inward and forward by asking ourselves: “How can I apply the Eightfold Path?” It can also be beneficial to use the different sections of the Eightfold Path as an end-of-day reflection.
## Chapter 23: WISE UNDERSTANDING:
### ID: p23-1
As we engage in the world, rather than withdraw from it, we can use Wise Understanding to live without clinging, attachment, or craving. By paying attention to our actions and the results of those actions, we can begin to change where our choices are leading. If we intend to act in ways that have positive results, and if we’re aware of the true intention and the nature of our actions, then we’ll see better results — better meaning less suffering and less harm.

### ID: p23-2
The word karma in Sanskrit translates to “what our actions cre ate.” Any intentional act — mental, verbal, or physical — is a kind of karma. Skillful or wise actions strengthen our sense of balance, kindness, compassion, loving, and equanimity. When we act unskillfully or un wisely — when we steal, lie, take advantage of somebody else, or cause intentional harm based on our own craving or delusions — it creates an immediate sense of imbalance. It fights with our intention to avoid harming others. Karma is determined by our intention and applies to any volitional or purposeful action. The result of our volitional actions may be an increase in our happiness or may lead to additional suffering. There is no actor apart from action, and there is no action without intention.

### ID: p23-3
Unskillful actions leave us less able to meet the next challenge or pain we face. For example, when we steal, we have to immediately justify to ourselves why our greed was more important than the harm we caused by taking. We must create a cover story, hide our actions, and adjust to the fear of getting caught. Ultimately, if the theft gets discovered, we might have to deal with financial or legal consequences, or face a lack of trust from our community. Similarly, when we’re dishonest, we immediately focus energy on maintaining the untruth. We must emotionally carry the potential pain that is caused to others, and ourselves, if the lie is revealed.

### ID: p23-4
This understanding of karma rests on the insight that we are responsible for our own happiness and misery, and there is a cause to every experience of happiness or misery. From a Buddhist point of view, our choices — which are dependent on our present mental, moral, intellectual, and emotional conditions — decide the effects of our actions. If we act skillfully, with understanding and compassion, it’s possible to cause positive, beneficial effects for ourselves and others. If we act with unskillful intention, we cause our own suffering.

### ID: p23-5
This doesn’t mean that we always have control over our experiences. No matter how skillfully we act, the external world — people, places, things, societal structures — might not give us what we want. This does not mean we have “bad karma,” or that we’ve failed. It just means that we’re not in control of everything and everyone. The point is that, regardless of what the outside world throws at us, we’re responsible for how we respond to it and how we tend to our internal world. At the end of the day, we have the choice whether we go to bed as somebody who acted wisely and compassionately, or as somebody who didn’t. 
### ID: p23-6
It’s important to note that being responsible for our own hap piness and suffering doesn’t mean we’re responsible for pain inflicted on us by others, or by circumstances out of our control. Many of us have experiences of victimization, oppression, and trauma through no fault of our own. The pain from these experiences should be met with compassion, understanding, and wise boundaries, not minimized, invalidated, or pushed away. In recovery, we learn that we don’t have to add an extra layer of suffering to this pain. We can begin to heal rather than let these experiences or the action of others control and limit us. Without discounting or ignoring the ongoing effects of trauma in our lives, we begin to understand that our responses when that trauma comes up for us, can change our experience of suffering and happiness.

### ID: p23-7
The Buddhist perspective is that our present mental, moral, in tellectual, and emotional circumstances are the direct result of our ac tions and habits, both past and present. How we choose to respond when confronted with pain or discomfort will change our ability to skillfully deal with suffering when it arises. We can also take solace in the fact that we’re not alone, that every person has difficult and unpleasant experienc es. It’s how we respond to pain that determines our experience.

## Chapter 24: WISE INTENTION:

### ID: p24-1
Wise Intention describes the attitude or approach we take to ward ourselves and the world. We can choose non-harming by avoiding actions that have harmful results, detaching from the cravings that seem overwhelming in the moment, and developing a kind and compassionate stance toward ourselves and the world. Wise Intention leads us to stop doing things based on confusion, ill-will, hatred, violence, and selfish ness. It impacts all our relationships: with ourselves, other people, our community, and the world as a whole.

### ID: p24-2
Wise Intention is deciding to act in ways that produce good kar ma and to avoid actions that produce bad karma. We start by looking at the kinds of thoughts that cause us to act in wise or unwise ways. If our thoughts are based on confusion, fear, and greed, then our actions will bring bad results and create harm. If our thoughts are based on generos ity, compassion, and avoiding clinging, then our actions will bring good results. Thoughts that are based in lovingkindness and goodwill, that are free from the desire or intention to cause harm, lead us to act in a beneficial manner.

### ID: p24-3
There may be times when we don’t necessarily want to act in a beneficial manner. We may know the right thing to do, but just don’t want to do it. It’s in these moments we can focus on our intention. May be we aren’t ready to do the difficult thing, to quit a certain behavior, to set a boundary, or forgive someone for whom we hold a resentment. But we can set the intention to do so, and investigate our willingness in meditation by repeating statements like “May I have the willingness to forgive…. May I have the willingness to quit smoking (or skip that piece of cake, or stay off the internet tonight, etc.)…. May I have the willingness to make amends to my partner.”

### ID: p24-5
The first choice we can make in Wise Intention is that of generosity. Generosity teaches us how to let go of our self-centeredness, to let go of clinging to ideas of “mine” and “me.” Selfishness, or self centeredness, is one of the ways we justify and cling to our addictive behaviors. Generosity comes from the awareness that we’re holding on too tightly to our selfishness. The karmic result of looking at the world only through the lens of “me” and “mine” and “what I want” leads to loneliness, sepa ration, and dissatisfaction. Letting go of this clinging can be the solution. Letting go of “me” and “mine” does not mean you need to stop acknowl edging your social identities within your community.

### ID: p24-6
Without generosity, the mind is confined to a small, tight space. Anything that’s not about “me and mine” is off limits. At times in our lives when we become dependent, our world becomes focused on sat isfying our cravings, on holding onto what we want right now. We get sucked into the reactivity of survival mode, believing that we must have our addictive substance or behavior to survive. Our "needs" for relief or pleasure consume us, and we become blind to the needs of those around us. We may even begin to see them as threats.

### ID: p24-7
We can break out of this cycle by opening our hearts: by being present for, and in service to other people. Generosity allows space to re spond to those around us, to include their well-being in our choices. This can, of course, be a tricky concept for those of us who struggle with issues of codependency. Generosity does not mean giving of ourselves without boundaries until we are depleted. It does not mean using “helping” as a form of manipulation to get what we want. Again, what’s important here is that we’re honest about the intention behind our actions.

### ID: p24-8
We try not to confuse intent with impact. Our intention may be to not harm, but sometimes the impact is that someone feels hurt. Many of us have experienced this in our addictions. Without intending to, and often without even being aware of it, we’ve created harm in other people’s lives. The way we choose to practice compassion in recovery is by being accountable when our actions hurt someone, and by acknowledging this hurt without blame or shame, defensiveness or justification. This includes when we offend someone by inadvertently using unwise speech or actions in regards to their social identity, such as race or gender. In these moments, it is important to recognize the difference between intent and impact, and having a deep appreciation and compassion for the interconnectedness among us all.

### ID: p24-9
Generosity allows us to cultivate **appreciative joy**, which is one of the four **heart practices** of Buddhism, along with compassion, lov ingkindness, and equanimity. Joyful appreciation is simply being hap py when somebody else has good fortune, happiness, and peacefulness. Generosity lets us appreciate the happiness of others rather than having feelings of envy, jealousy, or wanting them to be just a bit less happy so we seem a little happier by comparison. We want the other person’s hap piness to increase, for them to become more at peace, and so we learn to appreciate those things in their lives. In the moment of giving, of generosity, we’ve let go of self-centered desire and grasping what is “mine,” or what brings me pleasure. We’re giving up any ill-will or aversion we feel toward the person and toward the world. Instead of creating separation and withdrawal, we’re actively fostering appreciation for the closeness and connectedness of the world.

### ID: p24-10
This is a joy that’s not obstructed by selfish desires, envy, or re sentment. It’s the purity of happiness for someone else’s good fortune. We can choose to cultivate this feeling of joy in the happiness and success of others, without the need to compete or compare. It’s actually a feeling that’s natural to humans, but it’s often neglected when our attention is focused on selfish craving. This is the true seat of generosity: delighting in the happiness of others, without needing anything in return.

### ID: p24-11
The second heart practice is **compassion**, which is first of all a will ingness to come close to pain: to recognize it, honor it, acknowledge it, and respond to it wisely. This isn’t easy, because just as we want to run from or suppress our own pain, we also want to avoid being with the pain of others. Compassion means sitting with our own pain and that of others. It stops the cruelty of indifference. Compassion for ourselves is crucial. Self-compassion is the key to healing the shame and guilt that we often feel as we begin to recognize the harms we caused through our addictions. You may also find that compassion is difficult to realize when it comes to those who have caused you great harm. In these cases, it can be helpful to focus on your own healing by practicing self compassion, engaging in wise reflection of the Four Noble Truths, and committing to the practices of the path. With time, you may gradually wish for the relief of suffering for those who have hurt you.

### ID: p24-12
Compassion is not just offering sympathy and a helping hand. It’s also an intention to avoid causing harm to others and ourselves. This is where we can most easily see the difference between skillful and un skillful actions, and between wise and unwise intentions. Cruelty — and all the harm it creates in the world — comes from a lack of compassion. Cruelty is a desire to cause pain. Compassion is caring about the welfare and happiness of others. Compassion rests on the renunciation of harm ing living beings and is not only the wish, but also the intention to put an end to their suffering. We need to open our hearts — not just our minds — to all the suffering that is experienced in the world. Compassion is not only a feeling: it is an action.

### ID: p24-13
The 3rd heart practice is **lovingkindness**, also known as **metta**. These are thoughts that are free from ill-will, simply wishing that some body else be happy, that they be well, and free from suffering. It’s the choice to consider the well-being of everyone in how we interact with the world. Metta isn’t conditional: it isn’t something we offer only to people we like. We can have concern and care even when we’re feeling our own pain. We can bring metta to mind when we’re faced with difficulty or torn by conflicting feelings about the conditions of life at the moment. Metta doesn’t depend on people acting in a certain way, on our feeling a certain way in the moment, or on the result of our caring. It frees us from only caring about the well-being of others when we think it will lead to some outcome. With metta, we don’t ask the question “Will it do any good to care about this person’s well-being?”

### ID: p24-14
This means that how we think about another person isn’t based on their behavior, or even on the other person at all. How we think about a person is up to us—and if it’s shaped by the practice of metta, then we can care about every person’s well-being, even the most difficult and unpleasant people we know. We can honestly hope that everyone finds a way to be happy without causing harm. Wishing this goodwill towards others frees us from the reactivity and anger that can come when we focus on the person’s behavior or what we think they “ought” to do. We can begin to see the suffering and pain that somebody experiences as a result of their actions, and care about that pain even if it might also lead to pain for us or for others. Our wish is that all beings are free from pain and suffering, that they escape hatred and fear, that they are at ease, and that they find happiness.

### ID: p24-15
Generosity, compassion, and lovingkindness make forgiveness not only possible, but also essential for recovery. Forgiveness rests on understanding and caring about the pain and confusion that give rise to actions that we experience as harmful. We forgive when we focus on the person, rather than the action. We forgive only in the present when our hurt and anger make us aware that our resentment is blocking our own compassionate and generous responses. Forgiveness is not so much something we are giving to the person who hurt us, but something we give to ourselves. It’s centered more on our own conscious intention in how we choose to respond to them. Just as we sometimes act out of fear, greed, or confusion, we see that others do too. Forgiveness doesn’t mean we accept or tolerate harm. It comes from understanding and accepting that the person causing us harm is doing so from a place of pain and confusion. We extend compassion and goodwill to that person, even as we actively try to end the harm. This may mean creating safe boundaries or removing ourselves from exposure to harm. But we do this from a place of compassion and understanding, not resentment.

### ID: p24-16
It is *essential* that we extend the healing of forgiveness and compassion to ourselves. Forgiveness allows us to let go of the guilt and shame of our own harmful actions. We remember that compassion is an action, so when we forgive ourselves we also set an intention not to re-create or continue the harm we have caused to others and to ourselves.

### ID: p24-17
Making amends is an important part of forgiveness. As we begin to gain clarity about the harm we caused in our addiction, we commit to make amends for that harmful behavior. We don’t make amends for the sake of satisfying some external standard of morality, to be forgiven, or to get something in return. Instead, we use the process as a way to let go of our expectations and disappointments in others and ourselves — in other words, to let go of our attachment to a different past.

### ID: p24-18
One of the central principles of karma is realizing that I alone am responsible for the way my past actions impact my current responses to the world. We change our habits by letting go of the past and restoring balance in our relationships. Things we did in the past create patterns of behavior that continue to shape our thoughts and intentions in the present. That process doesn’t stop until we change our relationship with those patterns, and toward the people we’ve harmed. Amends are about restoring the balance in our relationships, not about asking for forgive ness from others. In a sense, it is an action we take to forgive ourselves.

### ID: p24-19
When we have come to understand and face the reality of our impact on others, we begin to understand the purpose of making amends. Practicing compassion leads to a desire to relieve the suffering of people we’ve harmed, and a commitment to not cause further suffering. Even if the person isn’t a part of our lives any longer, it’s possible to acknowledge their hurt and to offer them our goodwill and our remorse. Making amends means we do what we can to remedy the harm or wrong. If that is not possible, we resolve to do some good, not as compensation, but to develop our habits in a different direction. When we intention ally take responsibility for our actions, we let go of harmful avoidance and self-judgment and develop a sense of connectedness, peace, and ease. Amends begin with a willingness to forgive ourselves and take the path of reconciliation: not only with those we have harmed, but also with our own hearts and minds.

### ID: p24-20
Generosity, compassion, lovingkindness, and forgiveness allow us to experience equanimity as we face pain and discomfort, both in ourselves and others. The fourth heart practice is **equanimity**. During our addictions, we often responded to situations that caused us anger, fear, or resentment with a craving that the situations be different. We gave up and surrendered to the negative experience of life. Equanimity does not mean giving up; it is more a quality of leaning in. It is finding peace exactly where we are, regardless of external circumstances. Equanimity allows us to be right in the middle of things, to understand and accept things as they are without needing to escape. When we gave up, we said, “I don’t care what happens.” Equanimity, on the other hand, is being able to say, “I can be present for this.” It’s the acceptance that while there are some things we cannot change, we still have power over how we respond to them. While we don’t always have control over our thoughts and feel ings, we do have power over how we feed them.

## Chapter 25: WISE SPEECH

### ID: p25-1
Wise Speech is based on the intention to do no harm. We’ve all used speech in a manner that may create harm: lying to keep others from knowing what’s really going on; gossiping with the intention of putting someone down or satisfying our desire to be recognized; stealing time and attention by chattering on and on; or trying to convince others to meet our own needs at the expense of their own. Wise Speech includes all the ways we use our voices, including online and in writing.

### ID: p25-2
The basic foundation of Wise Speech is honesty or truthfulness. Dishonesty is exaggeration, minimizing, omitting or lying with the in tention of presenting a distortion of reality. It can take the form of “white lies” to avoid embarrassment or exposure, half-truths to keep from being caught, or seemingly harmless things said at the expense of others. We may say more than we really know to be true in the hopes of appearing smarter or more confident in our position or feeling. Sometimes we say something before we know the truth.

### ID: p25-3
Dishonesty has to do with our intention in speech. Are we moti vated by greed, fear, or confusion? Or are we motivated by a sincere desire to express what’s true, what’s useful, what’s kind, and what’s timely? Wise Speech means we speak with the intention of not causing harm, and of fostering safety and security in our community.

### ID: p25-4
In active addiction, we develop the habit of dishonesty. We lie to cover up or mislead others about the nature and extent of our using or behavior. We lie so we can satisfy the craving our fixation feeds, by hiding our actions, our feelings, or the amount of money and effort we put into satisfying our craving. Many of us lie just for the sake of lying because the truth represents a reality we can’t tolerate. We get trapped by our secrets, and for many of us, having a double life becomes an addiction all its own. This is why honesty is foundational to recovery. Dishonesty is one of the habits that allow our addictive behaviors to flourish. As a result, recovery needs to start with an honest appraisal of exactly what lies we told and what dishonesty we spread during our addictive behavior.

### ID: p25-5
The Buddha provided some guidelines for Wise Speech, in ad dition to truthfulness. He said to avoid slander and gossip, recognizing that such unwise speech causes conflict and makes the community less safe. So, when we talk about others, we can ask ourselves: What’s our intention? Is it to cause division or exclusion? Is it to cause shame or em barrassment in someone else, or to somehow make ourselves look better at somebody else’s expense? It’s possible to talk about other people with the intention of kindness, generosity, and compassion, to seek understanding or support for another. Gossip and slander do not contribute to this and instead, cause harm. Similarly, idle chatter and saying things just to be heard or recognized, or to take up time when we’re uncomfortable, can lead people to dismiss or ignore us and may create impatience and intolerance in our community.

### ID: p25-6
Wise Speech is also reflected in the tone we use when we talk. If we express ourselves in harsh, angry, or abusive ways, we may not be heard even if we’re being truthful. Speaking gently, with the intention of kindness, fosters a community of friendliness and safety. There are always exceptions, of course, and Wise Speech also includes using a loud and strong voice when you need to protect your safety.

### ID: p25-9
It may sound like Wise Speech is primarily about discerning when not to speak, but this isn’t always the case. Many of us grew up in families where it wasn’t safe to talk openly about our thoughts and feelings. Some, because of certain experiences or cultural conditioning, have been taught that we don’t have permission to use our voices or lack the power to speak and be heard. For many of us, practicing Wise Speech may mean learning how to use our voices that have been silenced, and to wisely communicate the needs and boundaries we’ve gotten used to keep ing hidden. At times, this includes speaking up for others when harm is done. Many of us, in an effort to be liked, for fear of rocking the boat, or due to the exhaustion of repeatedly not being seen and heard, have favored being nice over being honest and true to ourselves. Wise Speech teaches us that speaking up, even when it’s hard, is sometimes the best choice, and that speech is never truly kind if we cause harm to ourselves.

### ID: p25-10
Finally, Wise Speech is careful listening. It is also knowing when not to speak when a wise response isn’t available to us. We must listen with compassion, understanding, and receptivity. It can be really helpful to observe how much of the time we spend “listening” to someone else is actually spent judging them or planning what we’re going to say in response. Deep listening — without selfishness, or an agenda — is an act of generosity that lets us build true connection.

## Chapter 26: WISE ACTION

### ID: p26-1
Wise Action is also based in the intention to do no harm and to foster compassion, lovingkindness, generosity, and forgiveness. We try to do what’s skillful, and avoid actions that are unskillful. Wise Action asks that we try to make choices based on understanding and not unthinking habits or ignorance.

### ID: p26-2
The Buddha suggested that we make a commitment to avoid five specific actions that cause harm, a commitment which is known as the Five Precepts. We commit to the Five Precepts as our basic ethical system:
### ID: p26-3
#### Class: numlist
We set the intention to avoid taking the life of another living being,  or from causing harm to ourselves or another living being.
### ID: p26-4
#### Class: numlist
We set the intention to avoid taking what is not freely given, or stealing.
### ID: p26-5
#### Class: numlist
We set the intention to avoid causing harm through our sexual conduct, and to be aware of the consequences and impact of our sexual  activity and desire.
### ID: p26-6
#### Class: numlist
We set the intention of being honest, of not lying, and of not using  speech in a harmful way. 
### ID: p26-7
#### Class: numlist
We set the intention to avoid the use of intoxicants and intoxicating  behavior that cloud our awareness. 


### ID: p26-8
We need to continually reflect on and question the intentions behind our actions. We may have moments of clarity, but these can quickly pass, when old habits or thoughts resurface. We commit to con stantly reminding ourselves of our intention to Wise Action: to act in ways that are non-harming.

## Chapter 27: WISE LIVLIHOOD:

### ID: p27-1
The final factor in the ethical group is Wise Livelihood, which  focuses on how we support ourselves in the world. Again, the intent is  to avoid causing harm. For most of us, our work occupies so much of  our time and attention, so how we choose to make a living takes on  special importance. Understanding the principle of karma, and knowing  that unethical activity gives rise to harmful karma, whatever choices or  circumstances lead us to a particular job need to be recognized as having  karmic consequences.
### ID: p27-2
We try to avoid jobs that give rise to suffering and seek work  that does no harm or reduces suffering. The Buddha mentions five kinds  of livelihood to avoid: trading in weapons or instruments of killing, traf ficking in or selling human beings, killing of other beings, making or  selling addictive drugs, or business in poison. We’re encouraged to avoid  occupations based on dishonesty or injury. 
### ID: p27-3
Whatever our job is, we can practice it mindfully, with an in tention of non-harm, of easing suffering, and of compassion. This means  developing an attitude toward our occupation beyond just the money we  make. We can develop an approach of service and caring about the effects  of our actions on others, both within and outside our workspaces. Wise  Livelihood is not about judging ourselves or others for their choice of  work or trying to limit their choices. Instead, we try to understand why  and how we engage in whatever occupation we practice. Whatever work  we do, we can maintain an intention of benefiting others.

## Chapter 28: WISE EFFORT:

### ID: p28-1
Wise Effort is the first of the concentration group. It means  concentrating our effort on understanding and recovery and awakening.  Wise Effort isn’t based on how much we should meditate, how much  service we should do, or how much time we put into healthy activity. Instead, it’s the intention to devote balanced energy to supporting the  other parts of the path, particularly wisdom.
### ID: p28-2
The first thing to pay attention to is avoiding situations and  states of mind that can lead to unethical, unskillful, or harmful respons es. We become more aware of conditions in our lives and investigate our  own responses and reactions to those conditions. When we’re operating  out of greed, ignorance, confusion, or thinking we can get what we want,  we need to be aware of that. We put in the effort and energy to under stand what circumstances allowed these conditions to arise and how we  can begin to move away from those responses. 
### ID: p28-3
Energy or effort is also devoted to letting compassion, lovingk indness, generosity, and forgiveness arise when they’re not present. If we  find ourselves reacting with anger rather than compassion, fear instead  of generosity, blame instead of forgiveness, we can ask how we would  respond if those positive factors were present, and begin to respond more  skillfully. Being hard on ourselves, beating ourselves up, and suffering  from perfectionism are all familiar feelings during addiction and recov ery. When we shame ourselves for not being good enough, not trying  hard enough, not being enough, these are perfect opportunities to prac tice Wise Effort, to reflect on the question, “In this moment, how can I  be kind and gentle with myself?”
### ID: p28-3
In early recovery, we may be most interested in damage control:  simply stopping the destruction and demoralization we have suffered  through our habitual, unskillful responses to craving. We can begin by  awareness of that craving, and learning to make different choices that  don’t trigger the craving. Sometimes awareness is enough; sometimes  that’s all the effort we can muster. As we learn more skillful responses  to our triggers, we gain space to have more compassion, lovingkindness,  generosity, and forgiveness. And as this practice becomes more of a habit,  equanimity and peacefulness begin to replace our habits of grasping and  selfishness. Pacing ourselves is important, alternating periods of activity  and rest. We need to be aware of what our mind, emotions, body, and  recovery can handle right now, and avoid the stress that can come from  pushing ourselves too far, too fast. We need to avoid those things that  put us into unskillful mind-states, and try to do things that return us to  a more easeful way of being in the present moment.
### ID: p28-4
Try to remember that whatever your experience is right now,  it will pass. Remind yourself that you don’t really know how long an  unpleasant or painful experience will last. Try to be open to recognizing  and investigating the experience while it is present, without interpreting it as a permanent part of your experience. Recognizing that the craving,  experience, or thought will pass makes it easier to avoid the impulse to  make an immediate, unskillful response.

## Chapter 29: WISE MINDFULNESS:
### ID: p29-1
Mindfulness — being present to what’s going on in our minds,  bodies, hearts, and world — is central to the practice of the Eightfold  Path. We learn to be present for the way things are with compassion,  without judging them or ourselves. Mindfulness is being aware of what ever is present, noticing it, and letting it pass. It’s also remembering that  we’re on a path leading to our freedom and long-lasting happiness. 
### ID: p29-2
Mindfulness asks us to be aware and to investigate, without the  reactivity and grasping for control that leads to suffering. We learn to  stay attentive to what’s happening without having to either react to or  deny what’s happening. For many of us, our addictions prevented us  from being mindful. In fact, that was often the whole point: we used our  substances and behaviors to avoid feeling, to avoid being aware, because  being aware was painful. But by trying to avoid pain, we often creat ed more suffering. We’re now making a different choice — to sit with  the discomfort rather than pushing it away or trying to numb it. We  can learn to sit with the discomfort in different ways, either by bringing awareness to the physical sensations that affect our bodies or in a more  distant, non-attached way, such as naming the emotions while allowing  them to arise and cease. We’re choosing to respond to it with mindful  investigation and compassion, and to trust that it will pass if we let it.  We’re remembering that there’s another way to respond to the difficulties  of life.

Our minds can get lost in how we react to experiences. When  something happens, we almost immediately begin to create a story, plan,  or fantasy about it. We have a thought about an experience, that thought  leads to another, and on and on until we’re far from a real understanding of the experience itself. Mindfulness is noticing the experience in  that moment before we get lost in the judgment of the moment or the  stories we spin about it. Rather than blindly following our reactions and  responses to an experience, mindfulness allows us the space to choose to  respond skillfully and from a place of wisdom and morality.

Mindfulness encourages us to be open to and investigate the  painful experiences (and our habitual reactions to those experiences),  rather than to deny, ignore, suppress, or run from them. Most of us have  been conditioned to be our own harshest critic from early on, especially  during our fixations on substances and behaviors. We carry the shadow  of that judgment with us, even as we seek recovery, giving ourselves nega 
tive feedback and scrutinizing every effort we make, holding ourselves to  impossible standards of perfection. Letting go of that inner critic allows  us to be mindful in the present of the efforts we are making, mindful of  the compassion and lovingkindness we’re learning to make a part of our  practice and our lives. Remember that we often talk way more harshly to  ourselves than we ever would to somebody else. It’s useful to notice when  we’re treating ourselves too harshly, and then shift attention to what we are doing well. We can acknowledge the negative thought, and then gen tly let it go.

Mindfulness practice is based on the Satipatthana Sutta, or the **four foundations of mindfulness**. The 1st foundation, **mindfulness of the body**, asks us to bring awareness, attention, or focus on our breath  and to bodily sensations. Meditations on the breath and body are focused on this awareness. The 2nd foundation is **mindfulness of feeling and feeling tones**. This practice involves noticing the emotional tone — pleasure or displeasure — that comes with every sensation, even when the  sensation is a thought. It also encourages us to notice when a sensation  is neither pleasant nor unpleasant but feels neutral. For example, we can  experience inhales and exhales by noticing where in our body we feel the breath most directly. The second foundation instructs us to notice those  sensations that are neutral, as well as those that are pleasant or unpleasant.

The third foundation, **mindfulness of the mind**, asks us to notice  when attachment — also known as greed or wanting — comes up, and  to be aware that attachment arises in the mind. We also learn to notice  when the mind is not attached to a particular thought or sensation. The  same practice of noticing applies when we become aware of aversion,  which we can experience as resistance or even hatred. When aversion isn’t present in the mind, we can notice that the mind is free from aversion.

In the fourth foundation of mindfulness, **mindfulness of dhammas**, we begin to simply notice when a thought arises, being aware of it  without judgment or evaluation, and allowing it to pass away without  holding onto it and without creating a story out of it. Training in the  fourth foundation lets us be aware of thoughts arising and passing away,  and realizing each will pass when we let go.

Two simple practices can make mindfulness a part of our daily lives. First, we can stop whatever we’re doing at any moment, and pay attention to the physical sensation of three in-breaths and three out breaths. This simple practice grounds our attention in what’s present  right now, rather than in the voices and critics we carry with us. Shift ing from the stories and judgments we constantly create during the day  to this simple grounding practice of three breaths gives us the space we sometimes need to return to mindfulness of the present moment.

A second practice is to take time to inquire into the truthful ness of the negative or difficult messages we give ourselves. First, take  time to ask yourself whether the message is true. Second, ask how sure  you are that it’s true. Are you absolutely certain about what may seem like  an easy or automatic truth? Third, notice how you feel when you believe  the thought: Does it lead to fear, anger, sadness, desire? Finally, reflect on  who you’d be without the thought. How would you feel if you weren’t  caught up in the particular mindset or scenario you’re creating?

Think about times when you felt fear, doubt, or hesitation. Now, let  yourself become aware of their temporary nature. How might that  awareness have led to an outcome that was less harmful? 

## Chapter 30: WISE CONCENTRATION:
### ID: p30-1
The final aspect of the Eightfold Path is Wise Concentration.  Meditation practice begins with concentrating on the breath, the body,  the emotional tone of the moment, and the processes of the mind, be cause these things exist in the present moment. If we focus on breath,  for example, we’re paying attention to the present moment because our  breathing is immediate: it’s happening right now. Breathing is a natural  process that doesn’t require judgment or interpretation, and so it eases  the mind from the need to react.
### ID: p30-2
The purpose of concentration is to train the mind to be focused  and undistracted. Most of us, early in meditation practice, are distracted  by things around us; like a noise outside the room, a pain or discomfort  in our bodies, our own worries or judgments of the experience, bore 
dom or weariness, or thoughts and plans. These distractions can lead to  a feeling of unease or restlessness. This is perfectly normal. In our addic tions, we nurtured the habit of distracting ourselves and for many of us,  it became a survival technique. Concentration meditation gives us the  opportunity to meet this habit with kindness and patience rather than  resistance.
### ID: p30-3
Concentration, like the rest of the factors of the Eightfold Path,  is a practice. As with any practice, it takes time and effort to learn a new way to focus attention. In meditation, simply noting the distraction, accepting that it exists, and then refocusing our mind back to the object of concentration, is the practice. If we become focused on discomfort, thoughts, or plans, we need to first recognize that it’s happening, and  then become curious about it. Then we can make the choice to refocus —  to concentrate on the object of the meditation. Our habitual patterns can  seduce us into thinking we’re doing it wrong, into judging our practice, or into giving up. Don’t let them. When we observe what the mind is  telling us and react with compassion, knowing we have the power to  recognize it and refocus it, we strengthen our ability to concentrate.

Concentration can be especially helpful in times of craving. In stead of getting lost in the delusion that we must have what we’re craving,  we can trust that the craving is only temporary and refocus our attention  on our intention to act wisely. This may simply be the three-breath pause  mentioned earlier, or a more formal sitting meditation concentrating on  the breath. We can use concentration meditation to train our minds to  focus on a helpful thought in the midst of temporary discomfort and  the yearning for a quick fix. This may take the form of repeated phrases  to focus and clear the mind, such as metta, compassion, or equanimity  meditations. It could also take the form of prayer, chanting, a self-affirmation, a mantra, or another form of focused attention. Concentration  practices can often bring a sense of well-being and peace in a time of tur moil. They’re a healthy way to return to a balanced, resilient state when  we’re stressed or agitated.

Sometimes when cravings or unpleasant emotions are particular ly strong, moving the body can be the best way to help refocus our energy  and find relief. Concentration at those times may mean being focused  and mindful about each movement we are making: this is my foot taking  a step, this is my hand reaching for the cup. After a few minutes of concen tration practice, of not giving energy to our craving or obsession, we may  find the intensity of the feeling has passed. The more we do this, the more  we gain confidence that we have the power to relieve the suffering of our  addiction through following this path and committing to this practice.

For trauma survivors, the breath, the heart, and the mind can be  potentially overwhelming places to place the attention. So if traditional  anchors like breath and body are challenging, ask yourself: What helps  you stay present? What helps to calm your nervous system? It might be  feeling the floor beneath you, or holding a stone, or looking at a piece  of art on the wall. All that you need to be present is to pay attention to  something happening right now.

If you feel powerful emotions begin to arise during meditation,  there are some simple things you can do to remain present. For example,  you can open your eyes rather than keeping them closed, or give yourself  permission to back off from the practice you are working on. Do whatever you need to do to take care of yourself should such a state arise, wheth er that is taking some deep breaths, putting a name on your experience  (such as “flashback”), or silently repeating some compassionate phrases to yourself. Learning to turn our attention back and forth between challenging sensations and our own supportive resources is a valuable skill  that professionals call titration. You can be gentle with your practice as  you are working to develop this skill.
